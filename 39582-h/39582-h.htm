<h1>THE RIVAL PITCHERS</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3>THE OLD BELL CLAPPER</h3>


<p>Down the green campus they strolled, a motley
group of sturdy freshmen, talking excitedly. In
their midst was a tall, good-looking lad, who
seemed to be the center of discussion. Yet, in
spite of the fact that the others appeared to be
deferring something to him, he regarded them with
rather an amused and cynical smile on his face.
He paused to brush an invisible bit of dust from
his well-fitting clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t we going to make a try for it to-night?&rdquo;
asked one youth, whose hat was decorated
with a silk band, yellow and maroon in color. &ldquo;My
uncle, who used to be a football coach here, says
the freshmen always used to get it the first week
of the term. My uncle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let up about your uncle, Fenton!&rdquo; exclaimed
the lad on whose word the others seemed
to depend a great deal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
your uncle, your uncle, ever since you came here.
Give us something new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Fred Langridge, but my
uncle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again!&rdquo; interrupted Fred. &ldquo;I
guess I know what the custom is, as well as your
uncle. He hasn&rsquo;t been here in fifteen years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, but he says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, if you speak uncle again, I&rsquo;ll land you
one on the jaw, and that&rsquo;ll keep you quiet for a
while.&rdquo; The words, in spite of their aggressiveness,
were good-natured enough, and were spoken
with a smile. Ford Fenton, who seldom took part
in any conversation about college sports or frolics
without mentioning his relative, who had been a
well-known coach at Randall, looked first surprised,
then hurt, but as he saw that the sympathies of
his companion freshmen were with Langridge, he
concluded to make the best of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I know what the customs are here,&rdquo;
repeated the well-dressed lad. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I get turned
down at the exams, and ain&rsquo;t I putting in my second
year as freshman? I helped get the clapper
last year, and I&rsquo;ll help again this term. But I know
one thing, Fenton, and that&rsquo;s not two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; eagerly asked the youth who
had boasted of his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s this: You may not get the clapper, but
you&rsquo;ll get something else.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer Langridge silently pointed to the
gay hatband of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it off&mdash;take it off,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know it&rsquo;s against the sacred customs of Randall
College for a freshman to wear the colors on his
hat until after the flagpole rush? Don&rsquo;t you know
it, I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard something about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better strip it off, then,&rdquo; went on Langridge.
&ldquo;Here come Morse and Denfield, a couple of
scrappy sophs. They&rsquo;ll have it off you before you
can say &lsquo;all Gaul is divided into three parts,&rsquo; which
you slumped on in Latin to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenton looked up, and saw approaching the
group of freshmen which included himself, two
tall lads, who walked along with the swagger that
betokened their second year at college. The hand
of Fenton went to his hat, to take off the offending
band, but he was too late. The sophomores
had seen it. They turned quickly and strode over
to the group of first years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you look at that, Morse!&rdquo; called Denfield
in simulated wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;The
nerve of him! Hi, fresh, what are you doing with
that hatband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fenton did something totally opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the spirit of Randall College. He, a freshman,
dared to talk back to a sophomore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing it,&rdquo; replied he pertly. &ldquo;Does it
look as if I was playing ping-pong with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sophomores could hardly believe their ears.
There was no imitation in the surprise that showed
on their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike! Listen to him!&rdquo; gasped
Morse. &ldquo;Grab him, Denfield! Wow! But things
are coming to a pretty pass when a fresh talks like
that the first week. Look out now, youngster,
you&rsquo;re going to get a little lesson in how to behave
to your betters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two sophomores reached out their hands
to grab Fenton. He made a spring to get behind
a protecting wall of his comrades, and for a moment
it looked as if the second year lads would be
bested, for there were at least fifteen freshmen.
But Langridge knew better than to let his friends
get into trouble that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em have him,&rdquo; he advised in a low voice.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the custom, and he knew it. He deserves it
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the freshmen divided, and offered
no opposition to the twain, who gathered in their
man. Morse snatched off the hat with the offending
band, and, while Denfield held the struggling
Fenton, ripped off the ribbon. Then with his
knife Morse began cutting the hat to pieces.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, quit that!&rdquo; yelled Fenton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
new hat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Softly, softly, little one,&rdquo; counseled Denfield.
&ldquo;I pray thee speak softly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Fenton struggled to escape, the other
easily held him, and the freshman was forced to
witness the destruction of his nice, new soft hat.
Having thus, as he believed, wiped out the insult
offered, Morse carefully folded the ribbon and
placed it in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll get a chance to wear it&mdash;after the
pole rush,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you
will, for we&rsquo;re going to wipe up the ground with
you freshmen this term. But if you do, I&rsquo;ll give
you back your ribbon&mdash;er&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name,
freshman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenton,&rdquo; answered the humiliated one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenton what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ford Fenton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;Fenton, sir,&rsquo;&rdquo; counseled Langridge in the
other&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know how to reply to a gentleman?&rdquo;
asked Denfield fiercely, shaking Fenton from a
neckhold he had. &ldquo;Say sir, when you speak to a
soph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried Fenton, for the grip hurt him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Now remember, no more ribbons
until after the pole rush, and maybe not
then. This to all you freshies,&rdquo; added Morse.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know that,&rdquo; put in Langridge. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ll all be wearing them after next week, and
we&rsquo;ll be wearing something else, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nixy on the clapper, old chap!&rdquo; called Denfield.
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t stand for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; responded Langridge. &ldquo;All is not
gold that doesn&rsquo;t come out in the wash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! He speaks in parables!&rdquo; cried Morse.
&ldquo;Well done, old chap! But come on, Denfield.
I&rsquo;ve got a date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth holding Fenton gave him a sudden
turn and twist that sent him spinning to the ground,
and as he picked himself up the two sophomores
walked off, as dignified as senators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound them!&rdquo; muttered Fenton as he
brushed the dust off his clothes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good
mind to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, now,&rdquo; advised Langridge. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
sophs, you know. Go easy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no reason why we should let them
walk all over us!&rdquo; exclaimed a sturdy lad, who had
watched, with rising anger, the attack on Fenton.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a crowd of us fellows should take
whatever mean things they want to inflict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Clinton,&rdquo; declared Langridge.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s college custom, just the same as it is for
us to take the clapper out of the chapel bell, have
it melted up, and cast into watch charms. It&rsquo;s
college custom, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, it may be; but I like to see a
fair fight!&rdquo; went on Phil Clinton. &ldquo;I could have
tackled Morse alone, and he&rsquo;s bigger than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you could, but you&rsquo;d have the whole
sophomore class down on us if you did, and you
know what that means. No, let it go. Fenton
brought it on himself by wearing the band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d tackled me,&rdquo; murmured the
sturdy Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they had,&rdquo; echoed Fenton. &ldquo;Look at
my hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my uncle says I can have a
new one!&rdquo; piped up a shrill voice, in imitation of
Fenton&rsquo;s usual tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holly Cross, or I&rsquo;m a Dutchman!&rdquo; exclaimed
Langridge, turning quickly to glance at a newcomer,
who had joined the ranks of the freshmen.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been, Holly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down by the boathouse, watching the crew
practice. I&rsquo;ll give you an imitation of Billy Housenlager
pulling,&rdquo; and Holly, or Holman, Cross,
began a pretense of rowing in grotesque style.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Dutch all over,&rdquo; admitted Langridge.
&ldquo;He goes at it like a house and lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Holly, for he had seen
from afar the little rumpus. &ldquo;Has &lsquo;my uncle&rsquo; been
cutting up?&rdquo; and he winked at Fenton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; began the aggrieved one,
who did not seem to know when he was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
made fun of. &ldquo;Look at my hat,&rdquo; and he held up
the felt article, which was in tatters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;New style,&rdquo; commented Holly casually. &ldquo;Good
for hot weather. Fine for a souvenir. Hand it
around and we&rsquo;ll all put our initials on it, and you
can hang it in your room. But say, is there anything
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be, to-night,&rdquo; answered Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;so?&rdquo; asked Holly with a wink, the while
he pretended to ring an imaginary bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it mum,&rdquo; was Langridge&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;You
fellows want to meet at the boathouse to-night,&rdquo;
he went on, as if giving orders. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget
what I told you, and don&rsquo;t walk as if you had new
shoes on. Take it easy. Be there at eight o&rsquo;clock.
Come along, Holly. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge linked his arm in that of the newcomer,
and the two strolled off to one side of the
college campus, while the group of freshmen made
their way toward one of the two large dormitory
buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He orders us around as if we were working
for him,&rdquo; objected Phil Clinton. &ldquo;Langridge
takes too much for granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s been here a year, and I s&rsquo;pose he
feels like a soph,&rdquo; remarked Sid Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him one. He
thinks because he&rsquo;s got plenty of money, and comes
from Chicago, that he can run things here, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he&rsquo;s not going to run me,&rdquo; and Phil stuck out his
square, well-formed jaw in a manner that betokened
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to help get&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ed
Kerr, who was quite a chum of Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo; cautioned Sid. &ldquo;Here are some
sophs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A group of second-year students passed the freshmen
with suspicious glances, but, seeing no offending
colors, nor any other evidences of anything
that could be taken to mean that their traditional
prey had violated any rules, they saw nothing objectionable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention clapper,&rdquo; went on Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Ed Kerr. &ldquo;But I was
going to say that Fred knows the ropes better than
we do. If we stick to him we&rsquo;ll come out all
right. It&rsquo;s no fun to try for&mdash;for it, and have the
sophs give us the merry ha-ha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll try to get it,&rdquo; assented Phil Clinton,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like being ordered around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge doesn&rsquo;t mean anything by it,&rdquo; spoke
his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; And with that the lads
passed into the dormitory, for it was nearly time
for supper, and the rule was that they must come
to the tables neatly dressed.</p>

<p>A little later Langridge and Holly strolled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to the buildings where the three hundred students
of Randall College were housed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be on hand, eh?&rdquo; asked Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I reckon so. But it seems like a lot
of work for what we get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of it! You old anthropoid!&rdquo; exclaimed
Langridge. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Going
back on the college customs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an anthropoid?&rdquo; asked Holly Cross,
as he deftly juggled three stones with one hand.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that for good work?&rdquo; he asked irrelevantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An anthropoid is a second cousin to a cynic,&rdquo;
answered Langridge, &ldquo;and a cynic is a fellow whose
liver is out of order, which makes him have a bad
taste in his mouth and get out of the wrong side
of bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you camel-backed asteroid!&rdquo; cried
Holly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with my
mouth, and I can get out of either side of my cot
without knowing which side it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you coming to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; that&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holly and Langridge passed into the east dormitory,
where they had been preceded by the other
group of freshmen. This building was given over
to rooms for the first year and senior students,
while in the west dormitory the sophomores and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
juniors, as being the least likely to indulge in
hazing and horse-play, did their studying and
sleeping.</p>

<p>There are few institutions of learning better
known throughout the Middle West than Randall
College. It had been established several decades
before, and though small at first, and unimportant,
the thorough methods used soon attracted attention
from parents who had sons to educate. Many
a well-known man of to-day, who has made his
mark in the world, owes part of his success, at
least, to Randall College, and he is proud to acknowledge
it. In time, because of liberal endowments,
and because the institution became better
known, its influence spread, until, from a small
seat of learning, it became a large one, and now
students from many States attend there.</p>

<p>Randall College was most fortunately situated.
It was on the outskirts of the town of Haddonfield,
and thus was connected by railroad with the
outside world. It was far enough away from town
to be rid of the distractions of a semi-city life, yet
near enough so that the advantages of it could be
had.</p>

<p>The buildings composing the college consisted
of several in addition to the main one, containing
the classrooms, lecture halls, laboratories, study
rooms and the like. There was Biology Hall, a
magnificent gift from an alumnus, and Booker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Memorial Chapel, a place of worship, containing
some wonderful stained-glass windows. The
chapel was the gift of a lady, whose only son had
died while attending the school. Back of the main
college building, and somewhat to the left, was
a modest structure, where the faculty, including
Dr. Albertus Churchill, the venerable president,
had their living apartments.</p>

<p>Farther to the rear of the main structure were
two buildings that contained dormitories and rooms
for the three hundred or more students. There
were two dormitory buildings, the east and the
west, and, for obvious reasons, one, the eastern,
was inhabited by the freshmen and seniors, while
the juniors and sophomores lived, moved and had
their being in the other.</p>

<p>The gymnasium, which was well equipped, was
located a little to the left of the west dormitory,
and it adjoined the baseball diamond and the football
gridiron. Skirting the edges of this big,
level field were the grandstands and bleachers, for
sports had a proper and important part in life at
Randall.</p>

<p>Standing on the knoll in front of the main building,
one looked down a gentle, grassy slope to
Sunny River, which twisted in and out, lazily
enough, around a hill that contained the college
and the grounds. The campus swept down, in a
sort of oval, to the very edge of the stream. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
there is no finer sight in all this country than to
stand on the steps of the main building some fine
summer day (or, for that matter, a wintry one)
and look off to the river. If you are patriotic, and
of course you are, you will take off your hat to
the colors that fly from a tall flagpole in the center
of the campus.</p>

<p>Sunny River was a beautiful stream, not as broad
as some rivers, but sufficiently so to provide boating
facilities for the Randall students. On it, every
year, was held the annual regatta, Randall and
some other institutions participating. There was
a large boathouse on the edge of the river, located
on your left as you stood on the campus, facing the
water.</p>

<p>Sunny River flowed into Lake Tonoka, which
was about a mile below the college, and in the
midst of the lake was Crest Island. What exciting
times that lake and river have seen during the
summer season! What rowing races! What
swimming races! What jolly picnics! And, let
us whisper, what mysterious scenes on nights when
some luckless candidate was initiated into a secret
society!</p>

<p>On the farther side of the river from the village,
and near the junction with the lake, was a sort of
park, or summer resort. A trolley line ran from
it to the town of Haddonfield, but the students
more often preferred to walk to the village, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
than wait for the cars, which ran on uncertain
schedules.</p>

<p>At the lower end of Lake Tonoka, just over the
line in another State, was Boxer Hall, a college
somewhat smaller than Randall, while to the west,
fifteen miles away, was Fairview Institute, a co-educational
school that was well patronized. The
three institutions had a common interest in sports,
and there was a tri-collegiate league of debating
clubs that often furnished milder, if more substantial,
excitement.</p>

<p>It was an evening in early April, of the new
term after the Easter vacation, that a number of
freshmen, who had taken part in the lively scene
of the afternoon, and some students who had not,
met silently and stealthily back of the boathouse
on the back of Sunny River. The night was cloudy,
and thus it was darker than usual at that hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you fellows got the rope?&rdquo; asked Langridge
in a whisper, as he took his place at the head
of the little force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Phil Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;of course&rsquo; about it,&rdquo; retorted Langridge
arrogantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the time it&rsquo;s been
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do with it?&rdquo; asked Sid
Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use it to hang a soph with,&rdquo; spoke Holly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Cross. &ldquo;Prepare to meet thy doom!&rdquo; he added
in a sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Holly,&rdquo; advised Langridge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid the sophs are on to us as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll rush &rsquo;em!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil Clinton
aggressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do any good. We&rsquo;d never get
the clapper, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a good way,&rdquo; spoke Fenton. &ldquo;My
uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you and your uncle ought to be in a glass
case and in the museum,&rdquo; called Holly. &ldquo;Dry up,
Fenton!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Snail?&rdquo; asked Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied Sam Looper, who, from his
slow movements, and from the fact that he loved
to prowl about in the dark, for he could see well
after nightfall, had gained that nickname. &ldquo;What
do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you climb up the rope after I get it in
place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; whispered Langridge. &ldquo;I
guess it&rsquo;s safe now. There don&rsquo;t appear to be any
one stirring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mysterious body of freshmen moved off
in the darkness toward the Booker Memorial
Chapel. Their object, as you have probably
guessed, was to climb to the steeple and remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the clapper from the bell, a prank that was sanctioned
by years of custom at Randall College.
Once the big tongue of iron was secured, it would
be taken to a village jeweler, who would have it
melted up and cast into scores of miniature clappers.</p>

<p>These, when nickel-plated, made appropriate
watch charms for the freshmen class, and suitably,
they thought, demonstrated their superiority over
their long-time rivals, the sophomores. For it was
the duty of the second-year students, if possible,
to prevent the taking away of the clapper. The
purloining of it must always be done the first week
after the Easter vacation, and if this passed by
without the freshmen being successful, the clapper
was safe, immune and inviolate. Hence the need
of haste, as but two more nights were left. Once
the clapper was taken the class had to contribute
money enough to buy another for the voiceless
bell.</p>

<p>Silently, as befitted the occasion, the lads made
their way from the rendezvous at the boathouse
toward the chapel. Their plan was simple. On
top of the cupola which held the bell was a large
cross. It was the custom to tie a stone, or some
weight, to a light cord, throw the weight over the
cross, and by means of the thin string haul up a
heavy rope. Up this rope some freshman would
climb, remove the clapper, and slide down again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
while his comrades stood guard against any attack
of sophomores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to throw the stone?&rdquo; asked Ed
Kerr, as he walked along beside Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; repeated Clinton in a low
voice. &ldquo;You want to run everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Fred Langridge is a good pitcher,&rdquo;
spoke Sid Henderson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely to make the
&rsquo;varsity this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; was all Phil said.</p>

<p>The boys reached the chapel, and, under the direction
of Langridge, the cord and rope were made
ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a good stone?&rdquo; asked the leader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a hunk of lead,&rdquo; replied Ed. &ldquo;I made
it on purpose. It&rsquo;s not so likely to slip out as a
stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Hand it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lead was soon fastened to the cord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, now, here goes!&rdquo; called Langridge.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pitch it over. Be all ready, Snail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped back, and tossed the lead, intending
to make the cord fall across one arm of the cross.
But either his aim was poor, or he could not discern
well enough in the darkness the outlines of
the cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missed it!&rdquo; exclaimed Clinton.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so would you,&rdquo; growled Langridge.
&ldquo;Some one stepped on the cord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Snail try,&rdquo; suggested Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this throwing,&rdquo; declared Langridge
curtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look so,&rdquo; murmured Phil.</p>

<p>Langridge tried again, but with no success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; spoke Kerr. &ldquo;The sophs will be out
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge made a third attempt, and failed.
Then Snail Looper called out in an excited whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here come the sophs! Cut it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Langridge. &ldquo;Hold on! I&rsquo;ll get
it over now. Fight &rsquo;em back, boys!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>A GOOD THROW</h3>


<p>There was excitement in the ranks of the freshmen.
They formed in a ring about Langridge,
who once more prepared to throw the weight over
the cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em back, boys!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;We can
do it. It won&rsquo;t take five minutes to get the clapper
after the rope&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But first you&rsquo;ve got to get it up,&rdquo; replied
Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will. Cut out your knocking. Here
goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off to the right could be seen a confused mass
of shadows moving toward the chapel. They
were the sophomores, who in some mysterious manner
had heard of the attempt to take the clapper,
and who now determined to prevent it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; said Kerr ominously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; answered Langridge desperately.
&ldquo;Keep still about it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked fretfully.
&ldquo;You make me nervous, and I can&rsquo;t throw well.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! He must be a fine pitcher if he gets
nervous,&rdquo; declared Clinton.</p>

<p>Langridge glanced at the circle of freshmen
about him. There were enough of them to stand
off the rush of the sophomores, who, as they came
nearer, were observed to be rather few in number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it goes!&rdquo; exclaimed the rich youth, and
he threw the lead weight with all his force. It
struck the cross, but did not carry the cord over
the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At &rsquo;em, fellows! At &rsquo;em!&rdquo; yelled the leading
sophomores. &ldquo;Tear &rsquo;em apart! Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em
get the clapper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a struggle on the outer fringe of
freshmen, who crumpled up under the attack of
the second-year lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em back!&rdquo; yelled Langridge. There
was no longer any need of caution.</p>

<p>The sophomores were hurled back by the weight
of superior numbers. Seeing this their leader hastily
sent for reinforcements. Meanwhile the others
renewed their attack on the freshmen. Langridge
prepared to make another cast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never do that in a week!&rdquo; exclaimed
Clinton in disgust. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t some one who
can throw try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw, all right!&rdquo; cried Langridge, as he
untangled the cord, which was in a mass at his
feet. He was about to make another attempt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
when a lad stepped to his side&mdash;a lad who was a
stranger to the others. Where he had come from
they did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;I used to be
pretty fair at throwing stones. Your arm is tired,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Langridge suspiciously.
&ldquo;Are you a soph? How&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a soph,&rdquo; replied the other good-naturedly,
in a pause that followed a second hurling
back of the attackers, who withdrew to wait
for reinforcements. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a freshman. My name
is Parsons&mdash;Tom Parsons. I&rsquo;m a little late getting
here this term. In fact, I just arrived to-night.
I was on my way from the depot to the college,
when, as I crossed the campus, I heard what was
up. As I&rsquo;m a freshman, I decided to join in.
Hope it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; said Langridge hesitatingly,
fearing this was a trick of the enemy. &ldquo;You
may be a soph&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I assure you I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Tom Parsons.
&ldquo;Wait a minute. Is there any one here named
Sidney Henderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; replied Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to know me. I&rsquo;m to room with
you, I believe. At least, I have a letter from Dr.
Albertus Churchill to that effect. He&rsquo;s quartered
me on you.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; cried Henderson. &ldquo;Parsons
is a freshman, all right. I didn&rsquo;t remember
about it. Sure, he&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s a queer time
to arrive, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed Tom good-naturedly.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it, though. Train was late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here come some more sophs!&rdquo; called Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get that line over, for cats&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; demanded
Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I throw it?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;I guess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my own throwing,&rdquo; replied the other
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he knows how to throw, let him try,&rdquo; suggested
Clinton. &ldquo;We want to get that clapper
some time to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Fred,&rdquo; urged Kerr. &ldquo;I guess your
arm ain&rsquo;t in shape yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge murmured something, but as there
arose a general demand that he let some one else
try, and as a new body of sophomores were rushing
down to the attack, he handed over the lead
weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you pitch?&rdquo; he asked of Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>The two faced each other in the darkness, as if
trying to see of what stuff each was made. It was
the first time Tom Parsons and Fred Langridge
met, and it was rather prophetic that this first meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
should presage others which were to follow,
and in which the rivalry thus early established was
to be fought out to the bitter end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; urged Kerr. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have
our hands full now. They&rsquo;re going to rush us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Parsons grasped the lead weight, and
shook the cord to free it of kinks. He stepped
back a few feet, looked up in the darkness to where
the cross was dimly visible, and then, drawing
back his arm, sent the lead with great force and
straight aim up into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good throw!&rdquo; cried Sid Henderson, as the
moon, just then coming out from behind a bank of
clouds, showed that the cord had fallen squarely
over one arm of the cross, the weight coming down
to the ground on the other side of the chapel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good throw!&rdquo; echoed Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; growled Langridge. &ldquo;I could have
done as well on the next try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul up the rope!&rdquo; ordered Kerr. &ldquo;Lively,
now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several lads ran around to where the end of the
cord, still attached to the weight, was on the
ground. All around a struggle was going on, the
freshmen endeavoring to hold back the attacking
sophomores. Now and then a second-year lad
would break through the protecting fringe, only to
be hurled or pushed back again by the defenders.</p>

<p>Quick hands hauled on the cord, and the heavier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rope rose in the air and slipped over the cross.
It was held down on one side by several turns
taken around a post. Then it was made taut at the
opposite end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shin up now, Snail!&rdquo; cried Langridge, who had
again assumed command of things. &ldquo;Quick!
We&rsquo;ll hold the rope! Get the clapper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night-loving youth moved slowly forward.
But, in spite of his lack of speed, he managed to
make good time up the rope, which he skilfully
ascended hand over hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em get the clapper!&rdquo; &ldquo;Break
through and yank down the rope!&rdquo; were the cries
of the sophomores.</p>

<p>Again and again they hurled themselves against
the circle of freshmen, who protected the two
groups of their comrades holding either end of
the rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em, boys! Hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; pleaded Langridge.</p>

<p>Tom Parsons threw himself into the thick of the
fight. He gave blows, and he took them, all in
good nature. Once, when a small sophomore
broke through, Tom picked him up bodily and deposited
him outside the circle of defenders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, he&rsquo;s got muscle, all right,&rdquo; observed
Clinton to Kerr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what. There&rsquo;s class there, all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what he&rsquo;d give Langridge a
rub for pitcher, if he plays baseball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll play, all right. A fellow who can
throw as he did can&rsquo;t help playing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Sid in a breathing spell,
following a temporary repulse of the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The new lad&mdash;Tom Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he plays ball,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;His father
knows my father. They used to be chums in Northville,
a country town. That&rsquo;s how Tom happened
to come here, and he asked if he couldn&rsquo;t room
with me. He plays ball, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitch?&rdquo; asked Clinton laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. Look out, here they come again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted to repel another
rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out below!&rdquo; suddenly called the Snail
from his perch near the cupola.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got the clapper?&rdquo; yelled Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep! Here it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something fell with a thud in the midst of a
group of freshmen. It was the bell clapper, which
the Snail had unhooked. Tom Parsons made a
dive for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge roughly,
as he shoved the newcomer to one side and grabbed
up the mass of iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was only going to help,&rdquo; replied Tom good-naturedly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut with it!&rdquo; ordered Kerr. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hold
&rsquo;em much longer, and we don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em to get it
now. Skip, Langridge. Take some interference
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if it was a football game, several lads made
a sort of flying wedge in front of Langridge, with
him inside the apex, and, thus protected, he bored
through the mass of sophomores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After him!&rdquo; yelled several second-years, who
had become aware of the trick. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the
clapper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the lads rushed away from the chapel,
only those remaining who were holding the rope
taut. Some of these even started away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; yelled the Snail. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m up here yet!
I want to get down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave Sam up there!&rdquo; cried Kerr. &ldquo;Hold
the rope, fellows, until he shins down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several freshmen ran back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help hold,&rdquo; volunteered Tom, though there
was a temptation to join the fighting throng that
surrounded Langridge and his defenders.</p>

<p>The Snail slid to the ground, the rope was pulled
from the cross, and the lads, coiling it up as they
ran, hastened to the aid of their freshmen comrades.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3>A BASEBALL MEETING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Swat &rsquo;em, freshmen! Swat &rsquo;em!&rdquo; was the
rallying cry of the first-year lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the clapper! Get the clapper! Don&rsquo;t let
them get away with it!&rdquo; implored the sophomores.</p>

<p>There was a confused mass of arms, legs and
bodies. The mass swayed, now this way, now that.
Tom Parsons, the Snail, Ed Kerr and some others
who had remained behind to manage the rope,
threw themselves into the fray. Their help turned
the tide of battle, and the sophomores, who were
outnumbered, turned and fled, leaving the freshmen
victors of the fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got the clapper, Langridge?&rdquo; called
Kerr anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; and the lad addressed produced
the unwieldy souvenir from underneath his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then get it to our room and hide it,&rdquo; went on
Kerr. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not give up yet. We&rsquo;ve got to
expect a hunt for it to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kerr and Langridge, who roomed together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
started away, the clapper of the bell safe in their
possession, while the others brought up the rear,
a guard against a possible unexpected attack. But
none was made, and presently the long, iron tongue
was safely hidden in the rooms of the freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; remarked Tom Parsons to Sidney Henderson,
when the excitement had somewhat calmed
down, &ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;d better report to the proctor,
or to Dr. Churchill to-night. I&rsquo;ve just entered,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked his companion.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to room with me&mdash;that&rsquo;s settled. Mr.
Zane, the proctor, won&rsquo;t want to be disturbed.
Besides, I rather think that Dr. Churchill, our
venerable and respected head&mdash;by the way, we call
him Moses, you know&mdash;I say I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d
thank you for coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, there&rsquo;s been more or less of doings
to-night. Of course, the faculty are not supposed
to know that we take the bell clapper, but
you can bet they do know. They pretend not to,
and take no notice of it. If you were to go and
ring Moses up at this hour, he&rsquo;d have to become
aware&mdash;take cognizance, he&rsquo;d call it&mdash;of our little
racket. That might make trouble. No, on the
whole, let the proctor and Moses alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Moses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;why Moses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Well, we call him that from his
name. Church and hill. Moses went up on a hill
to preach about the church, hence&mdash;aha! see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t draw a map,&rdquo; answered Tom,
&ldquo;even if I am from the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, you&rsquo;re from Northville, where dad
used to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t boast of it, if I were you&mdash;especially
when any of the fellows are around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course it&rsquo;s all right with me&mdash;I understand,
but they might make fun of you&mdash;rig
you, you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand, but I don&rsquo;t mind being
&lsquo;rigged,&rsquo; as you call it. I fancy I can do some
&lsquo;rigging&rsquo; on my own hook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, it&rsquo;s your funeral. I&rsquo;ve warned you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks. But if you think it&rsquo;s all right for me
to go right to your room, and bunk, without telling
Dr. Churchill&mdash;excuse me, Moses&mdash;why, I&rsquo;m
willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Come on, we&rsquo;ll go to my
room. There may be some excitement after a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the sophs may try to get the clapper
back. They generally do. We&rsquo;ll have to help
fight &rsquo;em in that case.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. By the way, what do you fellows
do with the bell tongue, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid told about the watch charms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get one,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;That was a good
throw you made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe. It was hard to see in the dark.
I guess What&rsquo;s-his-name could have made it, only
he tired himself all out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t like him very well, but he&rsquo;s got
lots of dough, and the fellows hang around him.
He&rsquo;s manager of the baseball team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Got the election because he&rsquo;s willing to
spend some of his money to support the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s white of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Fred&rsquo;s all right, only for what ails
him. He&rsquo;s got some queer ways, and he thinks
some of us ought to bow down to him more than
we do. But I won&rsquo;t, and I guess Kerr is getting
sick of him. Some fellows think he got to be
manager, and keeps the place, because he used some
money. There&rsquo;s been talk about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Kerr?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellow with the black hair. He&rsquo;s catcher
on the nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to play ball?&rdquo; asked Henderson
as they entered the room Tom was to share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to. Is there any chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess so. The nine&rsquo;s not all made up yet.
They&rsquo;re going to have a meeting to-morrow, or
next day, and try out candidates. You&rsquo;ll have as
good a chance as any one. Where do you play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pitching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson uttered a low, long whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Langridge&rsquo;s pet place. He thinks he&rsquo;s
a regular Christy Mathewson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t disputed it,&rdquo; replied Tom
quietly. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m going to
take off my shoes; my feet are tired. Think any
sophs will come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely now. They&rsquo;d been here some
time ago if they were coming. Guess I&rsquo;ll turn in.
I&rsquo;ve got to get up early and do some boning on my
trigonometry. It&rsquo;s rotten stuff, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I rather like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; was all the answer Sid made, as he prepared
for bed, while Tom also undressed.</p>

<p>Tom Parsons had come to college, not because
he wanted to have &ldquo;a good time,&rdquo; nor because it
was the fashion, nor because his father had the
money to send him. Tom came because he wanted
to gain knowledge, to fit himself for a place in
life, and he earnestly wanted to learn. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
same time he did not belong to the class known as
&ldquo;digs.&rdquo; Tom was a sport-loving lad, and it
needed but a look at his well-set head, on broad
shoulders, his perfectly rounded neck, his long, lithe
limbs, small hips and deep chest, to tell that he
was an athlete of no little ability.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s hair was inclined to curl, especially when
he was warm from running or wrestling, and when
it clung about his bronzed forehead in little brown
ringlets, he was an attractive figure, as more than
one girl had admitted. But Tom, to give him his
due, never thought about this.</p>

<p>He was tall and straight, and he could do more
than the regulation on the bars, or with dumbbells,
while on the flying rings, or at boxing, you
would want to think twice before you challenged
him.</p>

<p>But Tom&rsquo;s specialty, if one may call it such,
was on the baseball diamond. He had played in
all the positions ever since he was a little lad, and
he and the other country boys laid out a diamond
in a stubble field, with stones for bases, and a
hickory club for a bat. But Tom had a natural
bent toward pitching, and he gradually developed
it, principally by his own unaided efforts, together
with what he could pick up out of athletic books,
or what was told to him by his companions. In
twirling the ball Tom&rsquo;s muscles, hardened by work
on the farm, served him in good stead.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>For Tom Parsons was a farmer lad, though, perhaps,
not a typical one. His father was fairly
well-to-do, and had a large acreage in the town of
Northville. Tom was an only son, though there
were two sisters, of whom he thought the world.</p>

<p>When Tom had finished his course at the village
academy, and had expressed a wish to go to college,
his father consented. He furnished part of the
money, and the rest Tom supplied himself, for he
was an independent sort of lad, and thought it his
duty to take part of his savings to gain for himself
a better education than was possible in his home
town.</p>

<p>So Tom, as you have seen, came to Randall, and
of the manner of his arrival, due to a combination
of circumstances, you have been duly informed. He
made two resolutions before coming. One was to
stand well in his classes, and the other&mdash;well, you
shall learn the other presently.</p>

<p>Tom slowly undressed. He was not used to
change, for he had been a &ldquo;home boy&rdquo; for years,
though he was no milksop, and did not in the least
mind roughing it. But, after the reaction of the
night, when he was in the little room with the lad
who was to be his chum, he felt a bit lonely. It
was new and strange to him, and he thought, not
without a bit of regret, of the peaceful farmhouse
in Northville, with his mother and father seated
in the big, comfortable dining-room, talking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the girls reading books, or sewing, under the light
of a big lamp.</p>

<p>Tom looked slowly about the little room that
was to be his &ldquo;home&rdquo; for some time to come.</p>

<p>Randall was not a rich college, and, in consequence,
the dormitories and study apartments were
not elaborately furnished. There was a sufficiency,
and that was all. Of course, there was nothing to
prevent the students from adding such articles to
their rooms as they wanted, or thought they desired,
and some, whose parents were wealthy, had
nicely furnished studies.</p>

<p>But the one occupied by Sid and Tom was quite
plain. There was a worn rug on the floor, so worn,
in fact, that the floor showed through it in several
places. But Sid remarked that it was a virtue
rather than otherwise, for it obviated the necessity
of being careful about spilling things on the rug,
and also did away with the necessity of a door mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t harm the rug, no matter how much
mud they bring in,&rdquo; Sid had said, when Tom suggested
getting a new one.</p>

<p>There were two small iron cots or single beds
in the apartment, a bureau for each lad, a closet
for clothes, but which closet contained balls, gloves,
bats, sweaters, old trousers and other sporting
&ldquo;goods,&rdquo; almost to the exclusion of clothes. And
then the closet did not contain it all, for many
articles overflowed into the room, and no amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of compression sufficed to get things entirely within
the closet. There was always something sticking
out. Several old chairs, one a lounging one with a
broken set of springs in the seat, a sofa that creaked
in every joint, like an old man with rheumatism,
a table with a cover spotted with ink, a shelf of
books, an alarm clock, some cheap pictures, prints
from sporting papers, and water pitchers and
bowls completed the furnishings.</p>

<p>Tom wondered, as he fell asleep, whether the
sophomores would make a further attempt to regain
the clapper, but they did not, and the night
was undisturbed by further pranks. At chapel
next morning Dr. Churchill, after the usual devotions,
announced with a twinkle in his deep-set
eyes that the reason there was no bell to call the
students to worship was because the tocsin was
clapperless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It mysteriously disappeared during the night,&rdquo;
went on the president, &ldquo;and&mdash;er&mdash;well, ahem!
I think matters may take their usual course,&rdquo; he
finished quickly, trying hard not to smile.</p>

<p>It was always this way. By &ldquo;usual course&rdquo; Dr.
Churchill and the students understood that the
freshmen would meet, make up by contributions
enough to buy a new clapper, and the incident
would be closed until another year brought new
freshmen to the college.</p>

<p>This course was followed. Langridge, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
president of the class, called a meeting that afternoon,
the amount needed was quickly subscribed,
and the money was taken to Dr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you encourage that nonsense?&rdquo; asked
Professor Emerson Tines, the Latin instructor
(dubbed &ldquo;Pitchfork&rdquo; by the college lads in virtue
of his name). &ldquo;Why do you submit to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He happened to be with the president when
Langridge brought in the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t submit to it, Professor Tines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you encourage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I simply ignore it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the clapper is taken year after year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; asked the doctor innocently. &ldquo;Well,
now, so I have been informed by the janitor, but,
you know, of my own knowledge I am not aware
of it. It is simply hearsay evidence, and I never
like to depend on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir, don&rsquo;t you <i>know</i> that the clapper
is taken by the first-year pupils?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; answered the good doctor with
a smile, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going to admit it. I was
young once myself, Professor Tines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So was I!&rdquo; snapped the Latin teacher as he
went to his own apartments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I doubt it, and that&rsquo;s not hearsay evidence,
either, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Churchill, as
he resumed his study of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Parsons, after chapel, introduced himself
to Dr. Churchill and the proctor, and was properly
enrolled on the college books. He was assigned
to his classes, and soon began to feel himself at
home among the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going?&rdquo; asked Sid of Tom that
afternoon, as they came from the last recitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the baseball meeting. Didn&rsquo;t you see the
notice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His roommate showed it to Tom. It was a
note on the bulletin board in the gymnasium, stating
that all interested in the baseball nine, whether
as players or as supporters, were invited to meet
in the basket-ball court that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>The size of the throng that gathered in the
gymnasium was proof enough of the interest taken
in affairs of the diamond by the Randall students.
There was talk of nothing save bases, balls, strikes,
sacrifices, bunts, home runs, fielding, pitching, catching,
and what-not. Langridge called the meeting
to order, and in a few words explained that the
object of it was to get the team in shape for the
spring games.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that there are a number of new
men with us this year,&rdquo; he went on in easy tones.
There was no use in denying that the well-dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lad knew how to talk, and that to get up in front
of a throng did not embarrass him. &ldquo;I hope, as
manager as well as a player,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that we
shall find some good material. The team needs
strengthening in several places, and it is up to us
to do it. Now I have a list here of the former
players, and the names of some who have already
signified a desire to try for places this year. I&rsquo;ll
read them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite a long list, and Tom Parsons, listening
to it, began to wonder if he would have any
chance among so many.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there are any others who would like to put
their names down as candidates, I&rsquo;ll take them,&rdquo;
announced Fred.</p>

<p>Several stepped forward, and their names were
noted, together with the positions they desired to
play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on up,&rdquo; urged Sid to Tom.</p>

<p>The country lad advanced to where Langridge
stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try for a place,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you would, eh?&rdquo; asked the other, and the
sneer in his voice was evident. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you
think you&rsquo;d better wait until the hayseed is out of
your hair?&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a comb,&rdquo; retorted Tom quickly, extending
a small pocket one. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll give
me a hand. I can&rsquo;t see the back of my head.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on you, Langridge,&rdquo; cried Phil
Clinton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time you got yours good
and proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was smiling good-naturedly, but the other
was scowling.</p>

<p>Tom looked Langridge straight in the eye, and
the other turned aside. The country lad put back
the comb into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; growled Langridge,
though he knew it full well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you want to try for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was some confusion in the room, but it
ceased at Tom&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitcher!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said pitcher,&rdquo; replied Tom quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m pitcher on the &rsquo;varsity nine!&rdquo;
fairly snarled Langridge. &ldquo;That is, I was last
year and expect to be again. Do you mean pitcher
on the scrub?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the &rsquo;varsity,&rdquo; spoke Tom, smiling the least
bit.</p>

<p>Langridge shot a look at him from his black
eyes. It was a look that boded Tom no good, for
the former pitcher had recognized in the new arrival
a formidable rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put his name down,&rdquo; called Sid. &ldquo;You might
get a sore arm, and we&rsquo;d need a substitute.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Langridge glanced quickly at the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is down,&rdquo; he answered quietly&mdash;more
quietly than any one expected him to speak.
&ldquo;Are there any others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet for practice to-morrow afternoon,&rdquo;
went on Langridge. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s understood
that no one plays on the team who
doesn&rsquo;t contribute his share of expenses,&rdquo; and he
looked straight at Tom Parsons.</p>

<p>Without a word the country lad drew out a
wallet, none too well filled, to judge by the looks
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the tax?&rdquo; he asked, still smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;er&mdash;the finance committee attends to
that,&rdquo; was the answer Langridge made. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
meet to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently he had not expected so ready a compliance
on Tom&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s all settled, I move we adjourn,&rdquo;
suggested Ed Kerr. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a scrub game,
for luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a lad came hurrying into the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Langridge?&rdquo; he asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; replied the baseball manager. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hazing!&rdquo; was the somewhat breathless answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
&ldquo;The sophs are going to try it on to-night, to get
square about the bell clapper. I just heard it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton. &ldquo;Now
we&rsquo;ll get a chance to have some fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll pay &rsquo;em back for slashing my hat,&rdquo;
added Ford Fenton. &ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what his respected relative had remarked
was not learned, as the boys rushed from the room
to prepare for the ordeal that they knew awaited
them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3>THE HAZING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What sort of hazing do they do?&rdquo; asked Tom
Parsons of Sid Henderson as the two youths followed
their companions from the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all sorts. It&rsquo;s hard to tell. Mostly they
come in your room and make a rough house, but
not too rough, for the proctor doesn&rsquo;t stand for it.
They&rsquo;ll tumble you about, tear down any ornaments
you may have up, pour a pitcher of water
in the bed, and make things unpleasant generally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we supposed to stand for that?&rdquo; There
was a grim look settling on Tom&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what can you do when three or four big
sophs are holding you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, that&rsquo;s a fact. But I&rsquo;m going to
fight back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I, but that&rsquo;s all the good it&rsquo;ll do. If
they don&rsquo;t put enough on you in your room they&rsquo;ll
tackle you outside, when you&rsquo;re alone, and maybe
chuck you into the river or lake, or make you walk
Spanish, or force you to parade through town doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the wheelbarrow act. Oh, you&rsquo;ve got to take
some hazing in one form or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind getting my share. So
they&rsquo;re coming to-night, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the twin said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The twin&mdash;who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little fellow that brought word. I don&rsquo;t
know whether he was Jerry or Joe Jackson. I
didn&rsquo;t look closely enough to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, is it hard to tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. They&rsquo;re two brothers, Jerry and Joe.
They come from some town in New Jersey. We
call them the &lsquo;Jersey Twins,&rsquo; and they look so
much alike it&rsquo;s hard to tell them apart. The only
way you can tell is when they&rsquo;re playing ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jerry plays right field, and Joe left.
Then it&rsquo;s easy to say which is which; but when
they come to bat it always happens that some one
on the other team makes a kick. They think we&rsquo;re
ringing in the same man twice, and we have to explain.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard. Of course, I&rsquo;ve
only been here a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then they&rsquo;ve played here some time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;re juniors. It was mighty white of
Jerry or Joe, whichever it was, to tip us off. Now
we&rsquo;ll be ready for the sophs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you know in time, as we do now, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
can take down the best things in our room, so they
won&rsquo;t get busted, and we can hide the bed clothes,
so they won&rsquo;t get soaked. Then we can put on our
old clothes. It&rsquo;s no fun to have a good suit ruined,
especially when you don&rsquo;t find new clothes growing
on trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s go to our room and make
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got plenty of time. I fancy it won&rsquo;t
be until after dark. The only thing is for all of us
freshmen to keep together if we go out. For if
they catch two or three of us alone they&rsquo;ll put it all
over us. But I guess there won&rsquo;t be any scrub game
now. The sophs would break it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do we have any rest from them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about two weeks. After the pole rush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pole rush?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s an old college custom, as Fenton&rsquo;s
uncle would say. We freshmen form a ring about
the big flag-pole on a certain night and the sophs
try to pull us away. If they make us leave inside of
fifteen minutes it means we can&rsquo;t wear the class college
colors until next term. If we win, why, we
sport a hat like Fenton had&mdash;the one Morse and
Denfield slashed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. But, say, I&rsquo;d like to know more about
the ball team. Does Langridge run it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two lads by this time were in their room,
where they proceeded to hide under the beds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
bureaus their choicest possessions against the prospective
raid. It was close to the supper hour and
they did not have much time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Langridge doesn&rsquo;t run everything,&rdquo; answered
Sid. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s manager, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is in a way, though it&rsquo;s only because he
has plenty of cash and isn&rsquo;t afraid to spend it. But
he couldn&rsquo;t be elected captain. He tried, but was
defeated his first term, though he made the managership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bricktop Molloy was last year, but this season
we&rsquo;re going to have a new one. I guess Dan Woodhouse
stands as good a show as any one. He&rsquo;s a
senior and a fine player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woodhouse&mdash;that&rsquo;s an odd name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we call him Kindlings for short. I&rsquo;m going
to vote for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So will I then; I&rsquo;ll depend on your say-so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy you threw a scare into Langridge,&rdquo; went
on Sid as he carefully slid under a mat at the edge
of the bed a picture of a football game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telling him you wanted to try for pitcher. It
was like stepping on his corns. He thinks he&rsquo;s got
a cinch on that position. Always has ever since he
helped win a game last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. It depends on who is captain.
Langridge wants to see Ed Kerr elected
captain. If that happens, he and Ed will run things
to suit themselves. Ed&rsquo;s quite a chum of Langridge,
though Ed&rsquo;s a better fellow all around. The
only reason some of the fellows won&rsquo;t vote for Ed
is that he&rsquo;s too thick with Langridge. But if old
Kindlings is elected he&rsquo;ll not take any orders from
Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very popular with
you,&rdquo; observed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t like him. Yet he&rsquo;s all right
in a way. You see, he&rsquo;s pretty well off in his own
right. His father died, leaving him quite a sum,
and when his mother died he got more. His uncle
is his guardian, but he doesn&rsquo;t look after Fred very
closely, and Fred does pretty much as he pleases.
Now that isn&rsquo;t good for a lad, though I don&rsquo;t mind
admitting I wish I had plenty of money. But
Langridge is something of a sport. He has good
clothes&mdash;better than most of us here&mdash;he has all
he wants to spend, and he&rsquo;s liberal with it. He has
quite a following and lots of fellows like him. He
doesn&rsquo;t care what he does with his money, and
that&rsquo;s the whole thing in a nutshell. That&rsquo;s why
he&rsquo;s manager and for no other reason. But, as I
said, Woodhouse won&rsquo;t stand for any of his dictation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a chance then,&rdquo; mused Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you will. I&rsquo;d like to see another good
pitcher on the nine. Maybe we&rsquo;d win more games
if we had a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m a good one or not,&rdquo;
answered Tom. &ldquo;I want to try, though. Back
home they used to say I had a good delivery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid did not answer at once. He was thinking
that to pitch on a country nine was vastly different
from doing the same thing on a good-sized college
team. But he did not want to discourage his roommate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said after a pause, in which he surveyed
the somewhat dismantled room, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether it&rsquo;s pitching, or catching, or fielding,
or what it is our team needs, but it&rsquo;s something.
We&rsquo;re at the bottom of the league and have been
for some years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What league is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot you didn&rsquo;t know. Well, it&rsquo;s the
Tonoka Lake League. You see, our college, Boxer
Hall and Fairview Institute have a triangular
league for the championship. But we haven&rsquo;t won
it in so long that the memory of man runneth not
to the contrary, as the legal documents have it.
Last year we had a good chance to be second, but
Langridge got a glass arm in the final game and
we were dumped. That&rsquo;s why I say we need a
new pitcher, and I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re going to try
for it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll do worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Langridge sure does deliver a good
ball,&rdquo; said Sid slowly; &ldquo;the only trouble is that
he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Tom questioningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll find it out for yourself,&rdquo; concluded
Sid Henderson. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the supper gong.
Come on. There&rsquo;ll be hot work after a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puzzling somewhat over the answer his chum
had made to the question regarding Langridge and
wondering what it was he might find out for himself,
Tom followed Sid to the dining hall, where
throngs of students were already gathered.</p>

<p>There was something in the air that told of mischief
to come. The sophomores, who dined together,
maintained a very grave and decorous air,
utterly out of keeping with their usual mood.
There was silence instead of talk and laughter at
their table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost as dignified as the seniors,&rdquo; remarked
Phil Clinton to Tom as he took a seat next
to him. &ldquo;It means trouble. Look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re looking out,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

<p>Few lingered over the meal, and, going back to
their room, Sid and Tom took their best clothes
and hid them in a closet at the end of the long corridor.
It was a closet used for the storage of odds
and ends.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll find them there,&rdquo;
spoke Sid. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re ready for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On their way back to their apartment they heard
some one preceding them down the long hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a
look. Maybe it was some one spying on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They hastened their steps and saw some one
hurry around a corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Sid slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it a soph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Langridge,&rdquo; came the hesitating answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he was doing up here?&rdquo; inquired
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder too,&rdquo; added his chum.</p>

<p>There was a rush of feet in the hall below and
the sound of voices in protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;The hazers!
Come on!&rdquo; And he slid into the room, followed by
Tom. They slammed the portal shut and bolted it.</p>

<p>The noise below increased, and there was the
sound of breaking doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they smash in?&rdquo; asked Tom, to whom a college
life was a new experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, if you don&rsquo;t open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not. Let &rsquo;em break in. They&rsquo;ll have to
pay for the damage.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of lively scenes on the floor below, the
noise was kept within a certain range. Neither the
freshmen nor the sophomores desired to have their
pranks interrupted by the college authorities, which
would be sure to be the case if the fun grew too
hilarious.</p>

<p>The noise seemed to be approaching the room of
Sid and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; whispered the country youth.</p>

<p>Sid nodded and there was a grim smile on his
face. An instant later the door was tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beggars have locked it!&rdquo; some one exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Break it in!&rdquo; another added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask &rsquo;em to open first,&rdquo; counseled a third.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve smashed so many now that we&rsquo;ll have a
pretty bill to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, blazes, give it your shoulder, Battersby,&rdquo;
exclaimed a loud voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to open, fresh?&rdquo; called out a student on
the other side of the portal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; cried Sid.</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause and then some one
hurled himself at the door. The bolt held for a
few seconds, but on a second rush there was a splintering
of wood, the screws pulled out and the portal
flew open, giving admittance to a crowd of sophomores.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>A SCRUB GAME</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Stripped!&rdquo; exclaimed a tall sophomore with a
broken nose. &ldquo;The beggars have stripped their
den!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you some one had been giving us away,&rdquo;
added another. &ldquo;They knew we were coming.
Didn&rsquo;t you, fresh?&rdquo; and he turned to Sid and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Sid as he looked around the
room, which was bare of the articles that usually
afforded the second-year men an opportunity for
causing annoyance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who tipped you off?&rdquo; asked he of the broken
nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell us,&rdquo; chimed in several others. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t do a thing to him but make him sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had a dream,&rdquo; put in Tom with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Here&rsquo;s a fresh fresh!&rdquo; exclaimed
&ldquo;Broken-nose.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, fellows, let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em a
shower bath, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look under the beds,&rdquo; suggested a big sophomore.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope; haven&rsquo;t time, Gladdus. Here, some of
you hold &rsquo;em while the rest of us douse &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant Sid and Tom were grasped each by
half a dozen hands and pulled to the middle of the
room. Then Broken-nose and some others took
the two water pitchers and poured the contents over
the two freshmen. It was not a pleasant ordeal, but
Tom and his chum bore it unflinchingly. It was
useless to struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is no fun!&rdquo; exclaimed Gladdus. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The odds are too heavy,&rdquo; retorted Tom
quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take any one of you alone,&rdquo; he
added, and he looked as if he meant it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take him on,&rdquo; pleaded a tall sophomore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;none of that,&rdquo; declared Broken-nose, who
was addressed as Fenmore. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got lots to
do yet. I wonder where their good clothes are.
They&rsquo;ve got on old togs. We&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em a soaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Sid were glad that they had hidden
their garments in the hall closet. There was a
hasty search on the part of the sophomores, but as
nothing was disclosed the second-year men prepared
to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; ordered Fenmore. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
water left in their pitchers, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we could get more H<sub>2</sub>O if we could find
their togs,&rdquo; spoke another.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then another second-year youth came along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where their clothes are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In
the closet at the end of the hall. Langridge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Gladdus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo; called Fenmore. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
soak &rsquo;em good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid groaned as the sophomores released him and
Tom and made a run for the closet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d ought to have scattered &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have to wear wet duds to chapel to-morrow.
We can&rsquo;t go in these,&rdquo; and he looked at
his dripping garments&mdash;clothes in which he did
cross-country running and played tennis&mdash;old and
somewhat ragged and muddy habiliments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what that soph said?&rdquo; demanded
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean about Langridge. He gave us away.
He told them where our clothes were; the mean
sneak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; chimed in Sid. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he
was doing up here&mdash;spying on us. Oh, I&rsquo;ll pay
him back all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So will I!&rdquo; declared Tom fervently as a triumphant
shout down the corridor announced that
their clothes had been discovered. The garments,
dripping wet and all out of shape, were thrown into
their room a little later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that put your nerves on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
gazabo!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid disgustedly. &ldquo;Oh, Langridge,
I&rsquo;ll have it in for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hazing went on until after midnight and
then the dormitory quieted down. Scarcely a
freshman escaped and those who absented themselves
from their rooms were due to be put on the
grill later.</p>

<p>Tom and Sid sat up late, wringing as much of the
water as they could from their clothes and drying
them somewhat by inserting an electric light bulb
in the arms of the coats and the legs of the trousers.
Fortunately their bedding was not wet or the boys
would have passed a miserable night. As it was
they did not have a good one, and they arose early
to hang their moist clothes out of the window to let
the morning sun finish the work of drying.</p>

<p>But they were not the only ones in this plight,
and it was a bedraggled lot of freshmen who appeared
at chapel&mdash;that is, all but Langridge. He
was spick and span as he always was, dressed in
expensive clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they get at you?&rdquo; asked Sid as he and
Tom caught up to the wealthy youth on the way to
class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get at me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your clothes don&rsquo;t seem to have suffered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is another suit. They wet one for me,
but I had this put away.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And no sneak went and told the sophs where
you put it, did they?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Langridge quickly, and he
turned a bit pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say no sneak gave you away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; and Langridge
turned aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; said Sid quickly. &ldquo;You know
all right and we know, and what&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll get
what&rsquo;s coming to you all right. That&rsquo;s all from
yours truly, but look out&mdash;that&rsquo;s all&mdash;look out,
Fred Langridge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; was
the cool retort, and then the students passed into the
class room.</p>

<p>It was two days later that the miniature clappers,
which had been made from the tongue of the big
bell, were received, and a proud lot of freshmen
they were, including Tom Parsons, who attached
them to their watch chains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if we win the pole rush, we&rsquo;ll be all to
the merry,&rdquo; exclaimed Phil Clinton as he walked
along the campus toward the gymnasium. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just aching for a chance to pummel some of those
sophs. They certainly made a rough house of my
room the other night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get the chance all right,&rdquo; remarked
Sid. &ldquo;The rush is a week from to-night. But say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
how about the baseball election? Isn&rsquo;t Langridge
taking his own time calling it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sure is. He&rsquo;s trying to work up votes for
Kerr for captain, but he can&rsquo;t do it. The fellows
haven&rsquo;t anything against Ed, but he&rsquo;s too thick
with Langridge. I&rsquo;m for old Kindlings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; put in Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to hold the election to-morrow,&rdquo;
said Phil. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last day, according to the
rules. Why, we haven&rsquo;t had a bit of practice yet.
We don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going on the scrub and who
has a chance for the &rsquo;varsity. I hope I can get
center field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you rather play there?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always have. I fancy I know that position
better than I do any other. But, to tell you the
truth, I like football better than baseball. I&rsquo;m
going to try for the eleven this fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you make it. But what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;
asked Tom as he saw a little commotion about the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a scrub game,&rdquo; exclaimed Sid. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
stuff. Come on. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get a chance. Langridge
sees that he&rsquo;s got to get things going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They hurried to the gymnasium and found that
preparations were under way for a scrub game.
There was also a notice on the bulletin board stating
that the election for captain would be held the
following day.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s got enough votes for Kerr?&rdquo;
mused Sid. &ldquo;I hope not&mdash;for the sake of the
team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd, including students from all four
classes of the college, moved off toward the diamond.
Rivalries were forgotten in the interest in
the game. The lads were not in uniform, but had
on old clothes. Langridge was issuing orders and
two temporary captains were chosen, they selecting
their men. Bob, or &ldquo;Bricktop&rdquo; Molloy, the captain
of last year, had one scrub team, and Pete Backus,
who rejoiced in the nickname &ldquo;Grasshopper&rdquo; from
the fact that he was always trying to see how far
and how high he could jump, had another. Langridge
assumed the rle of manager, though there
was little to manage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now play lively, boys,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I want to
arrange for some other games this season besides
those in the league, and we want to win some
of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his delight Tom found himself chosen by
Bricktop, together with Sid and Phil Clinton.
Langridge held a whispered conversation with
Backus, the other captain, and was promptly
chosen on that hastily formed nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pitch and Ed Kerr&rsquo;ll catch,&rdquo; Langridge announced,
as if that settled it. And it was noticeable
that Backus did not make a protest, though he was
as good a catcher as was Kerr.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you pitch for us, Parsons, me lad?&rdquo; asked
Bricktop with just a trace of rich Irish brogue.
&ldquo;Sure and I heard what ye did, me lad, the night
of the clapper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was mostly luck, I guess,&rdquo; replied
Tom modestly, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;d like the chance to pitch
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, then, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll have it,&rdquo; replied the Irish
lad with a twinkle in his honest blue eyes. &ldquo;Come
on, fellows. We&rsquo;re last at the bat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold me down, somebody!&rdquo; exclaimed Dutch
Housenlager as he turned a hand spring and came
down so close to Molloy that the former captain
was nearly sent over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling like a two-year-old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Dutch, me lad,&rdquo; exclaimed
Bricktop, relapsing into a broader brogue as his
feelings came uppermost. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a stable,
though, and we can dispense with the horse play
until after the game if you can accommodate yourself
to the exigencies of the occasion,&rdquo; and he spoke
much after the manner of Dr. Churchill, for Bricktop,
in spite of the fact that he was a senior, &ldquo;grave
and reverend,&rdquo; liked fun and his joke. &ldquo;If you
will kindly resume the upright stature befitting a
human being,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you may try to stop
whatever balls come in the direction of shortstop,
for there&rsquo;s where ye&rsquo;ll play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Dutch good naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreeable, my fair captain. But would you
mind keeping your hat on? When the sun strikes
your red-gold locks it dazzles my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on wit&rsquo; your blarney!&rdquo; exclaimed Molloy,
making a punch at Housenlager, who skilfully
ducked it.</p>

<p>The diamond was in fine shape, for it had been
cut and rolled and the base lines marked off in
readiness for the opening of the season. The
grass was like velvet and the clean, fresh green, contrasted
with the brown earth of the diamond
proper, the long white lines, the new bases and
the level field made a picture that rejoiced the
heart of every lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;And the
smell! Do you smell the green grass, Sid, and the
earth, and&mdash;and the baseball smell? Isn&rsquo;t it
great?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheese it!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton with a laugh.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be spouting poetry next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; returned Tom a little more
soberly. &ldquo;I never get out on a ball field but I want
to orate something like Thermopyl or Horatius
at the Bridge. The fever of the game gets in my
blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; admitted Phil.
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a great game. There&rsquo;s none greater except
football, and when I see the gridiron marked
off and hear the &lsquo;ping&rsquo; of somebody&rsquo;s boot against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the pigskin my heart begins to thump and I catch
my breath and want to take the ball to batter down
a stone fence and make a touchdown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit talking and get to practice!&rdquo; exclaimed a
voice at the rear of the lads, and they turned to see
Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, who told you to give orders?&rdquo; asked Sid
quickly. &ldquo;Bricktop is our captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re going to have a little warm-up
practice first,&rdquo; remarked Langridge. Then he
turned to Tom and said: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to pitch
against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was all Langridge said as he walked
away.</p>

<p>Two or three good batters on each side began
knocking flies for the others to catch and Tom and
his chums soon found themselves warming up in
earnest. The country lad discovered that he could
judge the balls quite accurately and he made some
good throws from a long distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; suddenly called Bricktop Molloy.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows! Out in the field. Parsons,
let&rsquo;s see what sort of a twirler you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom went to the box. He was a trifle nervous,
but he controlled himself as well as he could. The
first man up was Langridge, and there was an unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
look on the face of the rich youth as he
faced his rival.</p>

<p>Tom sent in an out curve and he was pretty sure
it was going over the plate. But he heard the
umpire cry: &ldquo;One ball!&rdquo; and he was much surprised.
There was a mocking smile on the face of
Langridge. Tom held the next ball rather longer.
He threw in a peculiar little drop. Langridge saw
it coming and struck savagely at it, but a resounding
&ldquo;thump&rdquo; told Tom that the horsehide had
landed safe in Molloy&rsquo;s mitt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One strike!&rdquo; yelled the umpire, and Tom&rsquo;s
heart was glad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton,
from center field. &ldquo;Strike him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge hit the next ball, though it was only
a weak liner, which Tom stopped and threw over to
first, but there was no need, for Langridge had seen
the uselessness of running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One out. Go on with the game,&rdquo; sang out
Bricktop.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>THE POLE RUSH</h3>


<p>Tom managed to strike out the next man, but the
third batter knocked a two-bagger, and Kerr, who
followed, sent a beautiful long fly to right field,
where Jerry Jackson muffed it. There was wild
delight on the part of Pete Backus and his men
when they got in three runs before Tom managed
to strike out another player, retiring the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; spoke Bricktop, but
there was some dubiousness in his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pitching was bum,&rdquo; acknowledged Tom,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll do better next inning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you will, me lad,&rdquo; said Captain Molloy
kindly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new ground to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a confident air about Langridge when
he took his position in the box and it was somewhat
justified when he struck out the first two men in
quick succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing better than I thought he would,&rdquo;
said Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good pitcher,&rdquo; admitted Tom honestly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for he saw that his rival had something that he
himself lacked&mdash;a better control of the ball, though
Tom could pitch a swifter curve.</p>

<p>Tom was third at the bat. Now a good pitcher
is usually a notoriously bad hitter. Tom proved
an exception to the rule, though perhaps he had not
developed into such a good pitcher yet that it applied
in his case. He faced Langridge confidently
and even smiled mockingly as a swift ball came in.
Tom was a good judge of it and saw that it was
going wild, so he did not attempt to strike it. His
judgment was confirmed when the umpire sang out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge looked annoyed and sent in a swift
one. Tom&rsquo;s bat met it squarely and it went well
over the center fielder&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on, me brave lad!&rdquo; yelled Molloy,
his brogue very pronounced. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take two bases! take two!&rdquo; cried Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it three! make it three!&rdquo; begged Sid, and
three Tom made it, for he was a swift runner, and
the ball rolled provokingly away from the fielder
who raced after it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can bat, anyway, me lad,&rdquo; observed
Molloy as Tom came in on a safe hit made by Sid
a little later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean I can&rsquo;t pitch?&rdquo; asked Tom with
a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. It only accentuates it, so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
speak. You&rsquo;re all right&mdash;<i>facile princeps</i> as the old
Romans have it&mdash;which, being interpreted, means
you can come in and sit at our training table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s side only gathered in two runs, however,
and from then on up to the eighth inning the team
Langridge was on held the lead, the score at the
beginning of the ninth inning being 10 to 8 in favor
of Backus&rsquo; men. That inning Tom and his chums
rather went to pieces as regarded fielding, nor did
Tom shine brilliantly in the box. He struck out
two men and then he seemed to lose control of the
ball. The bases were filled, two men knocking a
one and two bagger respectively and another getting
his walking papers. Then Tom got nervous,
and just when he should have held himself well in
hand to keep the score down, he gave another man
a chance to amble easily to first on four balls and
forced in a run.</p>

<p>There were cries of derision from the opposing
players and an ominous silence on the part of Captain
Molloy and his men. The next man got a one-bagger
and the player who followed him knocked
a pop fly, which Molloy, who was on third, missed.
The inning ended with three more runs in favor of
Langridge and his mates, making the score 13 to 8.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six runs to win and five to tie,&rdquo; murmured Molloy.
&ldquo;Can we do it, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Phil Clinton confidently. Phil always
fought to the last ditch. But it was not to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Tom made one run and Sid another, but that was
all. Langridge struck out his last man with the
bases full and the game ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were a pitcher,&rdquo; sneered Langridge
as the teams filed off the field, and there were
several laughs at Tom&rsquo;s expense, for he had not
made a good showing in the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure he can pitch,&rdquo; cried Molloy, coming to
Tom&rsquo;s defense. &ldquo;The ground was new to him,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; retorted Langridge, and Tom was too
humiliated to make a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same he&rsquo;ll make a good pitcher,&rdquo; said
Mr. James Lighton, the coach of the &rsquo;varsity, who
had strolled out to watch the practice. &ldquo;He has a
swift ball, but he lacks control. We can make a
first-class pitcher of him, Molloy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; murmured the red-haired
youth. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do very well last year with
Langridge, though he seems to have improved to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So will young Parsons,&rdquo; declared the coach.
&ldquo;You watch him. I&rsquo;ll take him in hand as soon as
the team is in shape. He&rsquo;ll probably have to go on
the scrub first, but he won&rsquo;t stay there long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom did not hear these comforting words,
and it was with rather a bitter feeling in his heart
that he went to his room to dress for supper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be better next game,&rdquo; said Sid, trying to
console him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe there won&rsquo;t be any next game for me,&rdquo;
was Tom&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I saw Kerr and Langridge talking
together, and I&rsquo;m sure it was about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Kerr isn&rsquo;t going to be captain
of the &rsquo;varsity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ve got a straight tip. We&rsquo;ve votes
enough to elect old Kindlings Woodhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it proved the next day, when the election
was held. Dan Woodhouse received forty more
ballots than did Kerr and his election, after the
first test, was made unanimous, a compliment always
paid. Then baseball matters began in earnest.
Candidates were chosen, Coach Lighton ordered
regular practice and established a training
table. Tom was much chagrined when he found
that he was named for pitcher on the scrub, while
Langridge got the coveted place as pitcher on the
&rsquo;varsity, but Sid told his chum that the scrub was
but a stepping stone to the final goal. And when
the coach began to take Tom in hand and give him
some much-needed instruction about control Tom
began to feel that, after all, perhaps he had a
chance.</p>

<p>It was about a week later, following some rather
hard practice on the diamond, that a hurried knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was heard on the door of the room occupied by Sid
and Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; called Sid, looking up from his Latin
book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pole rush to-night!&rdquo; cried Dutch Housenlager,
poking his head in and rapidly withdrawing it, as
though he feared a book would be hurled at him.
&ldquo;Meet on the campus at eight o&rsquo;clock. Old
clothes&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to be a hard fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, throwing his
book across the room. &ldquo;Come on, Tom. We&rsquo;ll
have a battle royal with our traditional enemies, the
sophs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pole rush was like the cane or cannon rushes
held in other colleges. Half a dozen of the strongest
of the freshmen formed a circle, with linked
arms about the big flag pole on the campus. About
them in concentric circles their chums formed a
series of defensive rings. Then the sophomores
came at them with a rush, seeking to displace the
first-year lads and arrange themselves in a circle
about the pole. If they succeeded in doing this inside
of fifteen minutes it meant that the freshmen
could wear no college colors their first term. It
was to this rush that Tom, Sid and their friends
hurried when Dutch and some others went about
to the various rooms sounding the rallying cry.</p>

<p>Out on the campus that soft spring evening was
a motley crowd of students. On one side were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
gathered the sophomores and on the other the
freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, there are a lot of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; remarked Phil
Clinton. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but they&rsquo;ve rung in
some seniors on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; declared Sid.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a big class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge and some others were going about
selecting the men who were to form the first circle
about the pole. Tom and Phil, who were both
sturdy lads, were chosen for this honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In place! in place!&rdquo; cried the impatient sophomores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line up! line up, fellows!&rdquo; shouted Langridge.</p>

<p>Tom and his chums took their positions. The
protectors formed about them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold fast, everybody!&rdquo; cautioned Phil as he
grasped Tom&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come! here they come!&rdquo; was the
warning cry, and with a rush the sophomores
hurled themselves against the mass of lads about
the pole.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>TOM HOLDS HIS OWN</h3>


<p>It seemed for a moment as if the first-year boys
would be quickly shoved aside and their places
taken by the sophomores, for so heavy was the impact
that the outer and second lines of defense
were broken through and the attackers were in the
midst of the defenders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw &rsquo;em back! throw &rsquo;em back!&rdquo; yelled
Phil Clinton. &ldquo;Tackle low!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re playing football?&rdquo; panted Tom,
for some of his mates had been pushed against him
and he almost lost his grip on Phil&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a scrimmage,&rdquo; replied Phil. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the stuff, boys!&rdquo; he added as the lines of defense
formed again.</p>

<p>The freshmen by a fierce effort succeeded in
blocking the advance of their enemies, and those
who had penetrated part way into the circles were
hurled back. But the battle had only just begun.</p>

<p>Once more came the rush of sophomores, the
members of the class calling to each other encouragingly.
There were more of them than there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
were of freshmen, but the latter had the advantage
of a firm base of support, for the lads nearest the
pole clung to that and those adjoining them locked
their arms or legs about those of their comrades,
thus forming a compact mass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pick &rsquo;em off one by one!&rdquo; yelled Gladdus, one
of the leading sophomores. &ldquo;Bore a way in there,
Fenmore, and some of you fellows. We ought to
get them away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold fast! Hold fast, everybody!&rdquo; cried
Tom, for the joy of battle was upon him and his
heart exulted in the struggle that was going on
about him, in the pressure of bodies against his,
the labored breathing, the panting, the fierce grips
that were broken only to be made anew.</p>

<p>The sophomores now began other tactics. Several
of them would grab a freshman in the outer
circle. They would pluck him from the restraining
grasp of his companions, and then, when a hole
was thus made, other sophomores would bore their
way in to repeat the process. So quickly was this
done and so strong was the peculiar attack that,
almost before the freshmen knew it, Gladdus and
Fenmore, two of the most aggressive attackers, had
reached the circle that was about the pole. The
two boldly grabbed at Tom, at the same time calling
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophs this way! Sophs this way! Here&rsquo;s
meat for us!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom suddenly felt himself being pulled away
from the pole. The grips of Phil Clinton on one
side and Sid Henderson on the other were slipping
from his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold fast! Don&rsquo;t let them take you!&rdquo; cried
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; gasped Tom.</p>

<p>He thought of a trick he had acquired in wrestling.
Quickly arching his back like a bow, he
suddenly straightened it with a snap, and the holds
of Gladdus and Fenmore were broken. They were
hurled back and then other freshmen took them up
bodily, thrusting them beyond the outer line of
defense.</p>

<p>Then the whole body of sophomores quickly
threw themselves against the freshmen, as if to
force them away from the pole by weight of numbers.
They nearly succeeded, and Tom and his
fellow defenders of the flag staff thought their
arms would be pulled out of the sockets. But, as
if it was a second down in a fierce football game,
the freshmen held their opponents and thrust the
wave of sophomores back.</p>

<p>So it went on, the attack becoming fiercer until,
when the timekeepers announced that there were
but two more minutes left in which to hold or gain
the pole, the second-year men seemed fairly to
overwhelm the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear &rsquo;em up! tear &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; pleaded Gladdus.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, boys, hold!&rdquo; begged Langridge. And
hold they did, for when time was called the defenders
were found with their arms still locked about
the flag staff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We win, fellows!&rdquo; yelled Tom, capering about,
with his hands grasping those of Sid and Phil.</p>

<p>Then followed an impromptu war dance, while
the vanquished sophomores filed away in the darkness,
the exultant freshmen sending cheer after
cheer out on the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we wear ribbons on our hats!&rdquo;
cried Ford Fenton. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;d like to see any
soph make me take it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled from his pocket a band and fixed it
to a new hat he had bought to replace the slashed
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came prepared, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Holly
Cross. &ldquo;Here, let me give you an imitation of a
soph,&rdquo; and he held out the decorated hat, though
the gaily decorated band could not be seen in the
darkness, and pretending to regard it with horror,
minced along like some grotesque dancer on the
stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! good!&rdquo; cried his fellows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, Holly, old chap!&rdquo; remarked
Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you in the next play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fellows run the colors up on
the flag pole?&rdquo; proposed a lad who had stood
watching the fun.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Jerry Jackson!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid.
&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Jerry, I&rsquo;m Joe,&rdquo; replied the Jersey
twin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take your word for it,&rdquo; went on
Sid. &ldquo;Say, you two ought to wear labels. We&rsquo;re
always getting you mixed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amid much laughter and joking a long streamer
of yellow and maroon was fastened to the halyards
and run up to the truck. Langridge had the colors
with him, anticipating a victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to have a parade now,&rdquo; suggested
Fenton. &ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say uncle again inside of a week, we&rsquo;ll
duck you!&rdquo; cried Sid as he jostled Ford to one
side. &ldquo;We know him by heart by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he ever had an uncle,&rdquo; declared
Kerr. &ldquo;But come on, fellows, let&rsquo;s have a parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea took at once, and the victorious freshmen
formed in line and marched about the college
buildings, singing songs and yelling joyfully, for
it had been a good, fair, clean fight, and they had
won.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Haddonfield and get out hat bands,&rdquo;
proposed Langridge. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be wearing them
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As discipline was rather relaxed during the first
two weeks of the term and as it was the custom for
the victorious class to celebrate in some way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
idea was adopted and the joyous lads made for the
town, which at their advent at once awakened from
a sort of evening nap. They went to a dealer who
made a specialty of college goods and soon all were
decked out in the gay hat bands, all save a few
who, like Fenton, had already provided themselves
with the articles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you aren&rsquo;t used to such things as this
down on the farm, are you?&rdquo; asked Langridge of
Tom sneeringly as they were about ready to depart
for the college. &ldquo;Corn husking bees and quilting
parties are more in your line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, thet&rsquo;s what they be!&rdquo; retorted Tom
quickly, imitating the nasal drawl of the typical
farmer. &ldquo;We folks down Northville way is some
pumpkins when it comes t&rsquo; huskin&rsquo; corn. Was you
ever there, sonny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His manner was so patronizing and the effect of
his words and assumed mannerisms so odd that
the lads about him burst out laughing, much to the
annoyance of Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to the post-office for the mail and meeting
the pretty country girls was about the height of
your enjoyment, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; persisted the rich
youth, who seemed bound to pick a quarrel with
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, now you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; came the quick answer
in the same drawl.</p>

<p>There was something rather strange about Langridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
His eyes seemed very bright and his cheeks
were flushed. He evidently took Tom&rsquo;s acquiescence
as an indication that the country lad was
willing to have fun poked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you got lots of letters from the pretty
country lasses, enclosing locks of their red hair,&rdquo;
sneered Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I did,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, still imitating
a farmer&rsquo;s peculiarities, &ldquo;but I want to tell ye
suthin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; when you come out Northville way,
mebby you&rsquo;ll remember it.&rdquo; Then, suddenly becoming
serious and with a change in his manner, he
added: &ldquo;I also used to get letters from gentlemen,
but I don&rsquo;t believe you could write me one!&rdquo;
There was a snap in his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Langridge, taking
a step toward Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard what I said,&rdquo; was the retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time you got yours all right, Langridge,&rdquo;
exclaimed Phil Clinton. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell
by the looks of a haystack how far a cow can jump,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge fairly glared at Tom. He seemed
to want to make some reply, but the words stuck
in his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, and then,
turning on his heel, he linked his arm in that of
Kerr and the two started off down the street.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You held you own that time, Tom,&rdquo; said Sid as
a little later they followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t mind a joke, but he went a little
too far. My people live in the country, and I&rsquo;m
proud of it, and proud of all my friends in Northville.
But come on, let&rsquo;s get back to our room.
I&rsquo;ve got some studying to do.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3>AT PRACTICE</h3>


<p>Following the exciting scenes of the pole rush
it was rather difficult for any of the lads to settle
down to study that night, but for some it was a
necessity, and Tom and Sid were in this number.
Tom, by reason of missing the first week of the
term, was a little behind his class, but he was a
fine student, and the instructor saw that there
would be no trouble for the lad in covering the lost
ground. With Sid it was another matter. Though
faithful and earnest, studying did not come easy
for him, and, as he expressed it, he had to &ldquo;bone
away like a ground hog&rdquo; to get facts and dates fixed
in his mind. Consequently, because of the evening
of fun, ten o&rsquo;clock saw Sid and Tom busy in their
room over their books.</p>

<p>For an hour or more nothing was heard but the
occasional turning of the pages or the noise of a
pencil being rapidly pushed across the paper. At
length Tom, with a sigh of relief, closed his
chemistry and remarked:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I guess that will do for to-night. My
eyes are tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So are mine,&rdquo; added Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kiss
this Latin prose good-night and put it to bed,&rdquo; and
he threw the book under his cot. &ldquo;Pleasant
dreams,&rdquo; he added sarcastically. &ldquo;Gee! but I hate
Latin,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dad thinks I&rsquo;ll need it. I&rsquo;d a heap sight
rather learn to play the banjo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much comparison there, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but don&rsquo;t mention comparison. That reminds
me of grammar, and grammar reminds me
of verbs, and verbs naturally bring to mind declension,
and&mdash;there you are. Let&rsquo;s talk about
something pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you call pleasant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, baseball, for instance, though maybe that
isn&rsquo;t very pleasant for you, since you didn&rsquo;t make
the first team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Tom frankly, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t pleasant
to think about. I did want to get on the first team
and I may yet. But I&rsquo;ve learned one thing since
coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Maybe I&rsquo;d better call up Moses
and tell him. He&rsquo;ll feel encouraged that some of
the students are progressing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to do that,&rdquo; spoke
Tom with a laugh that showed his white, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
teeth. &ldquo;In fact, what I&rsquo;ve learned didn&rsquo;t have
much to do with books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s been made very clear to me that it&rsquo;s
something different from being a big fish in a little
puddle than acting the part of a small-sized finny
resident in a more extended body of water, to put
it scientifically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning what, if you don&rsquo;t mind translating?&rdquo;
came from Sid as he stretched out on the rather
worn and springless sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning that I had an idea that I was about
as good as the next one in the pitching line, but I
find I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; came calmly from Sid, who had his
eyes shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid I might disturb your slumbers,&rdquo;
said Tom quickly, and there was a curious change
in his voice.</p>

<p>Sid sat up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, old man,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I
was listening all right and I&rsquo;m interested, honest I
am. Only my eyes hurt to-night. But it must be
quite different, coming from a small village to a
fairly large college. Did you have a good nine at
Northville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Tom, somewhat mollified at his
chum&rsquo;s interest, &ldquo;we cleaned up all the other nines
around there. I was considered a crackajack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pitcher, but I guess now the reason for that may
have been that the others were rotten batsmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; admitted Sid judicially.
&ldquo;You see, things are peculiar here. Now
take Langridge. Nobody, unless it&rsquo;s Kerr and a
few others, cares much about him. Yet he&rsquo;s a
fairly consistent pitcher, and he&rsquo;s the best they&rsquo;ve
had in some years, they tell me. Now our college
has had rather hard luck on the diamond, especially
in the Tonoka Lake League. There was a better
chance of winning the championship last year than
in any previous one, but we didn&rsquo;t make good. It
wasn&rsquo;t altogether Langridge&rsquo;s fault. He didn&rsquo;t
have very good support, I&rsquo;m told. Now they&rsquo;ve
decided to keep him on, or, rather he&rsquo;s engineered
things so that, as manager, he keeps himself on.
And there are some hopes of pulling out somewhere
in the lead of the league this season. But
Langridge is his own best friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he keeps me from pitching on the &rsquo;varsity,&rdquo;
said Tom somewhat bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you blame him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know that I can,&rdquo; was the frank
answer. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;d do the same thing. But I
hope in time to be a better pitcher than he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you coming on with the coach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine. Mr. Lighton has given me some good
pointers, and I needed them. My curves are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
right and so is my speed. It&rsquo;s my control that&rsquo;s
weak, and I&rsquo;m getting rid of some of my faults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a practice game with you
scrubs to-morrow or next day,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;Maybe
you&rsquo;ll get a chance to show what you can do then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I want to show Langridge that he
isn&rsquo;t the only bean in the pot, to put it poetically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very poetically,&rdquo; murmured Sid, who seemed
to be dozing off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Sid,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom suddenly, &ldquo;do you
remember what you started to say about Langridge
the other day and stopped?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not tell. You&rsquo;ll probably find out
for yourself before long. I did, though not many
know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say what I mean. Only,&rdquo; and
Sid suddenly sat up, &ldquo;it may increase your chances
of pitching on the &rsquo;varsity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; said Tom slowly, and he began
to get ready for bed.</p>

<p>A practice game between the &rsquo;varsity and the
scrub was called for the next afternoon. The first
team was in rather disorganized shape yet. That
is to say, not all the players were in permanent positions
and shifts were likely to be made at any
time as practice brought out defects or merits. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was even said that some now on the &rsquo;varsity might
be relegated to the scrub and some from the second
team advanced. Tom secretly hoped so in his
case, but his common sense told him he stood a slim
chance. Langridge, of course, was pitcher on the
first team and Kerr was the catcher. Kindlings
Woodhouse played on third, where he could direct
the efforts of his men.</p>

<p>When the scrub and regular teams were out on
the diamond ready for the practice game Kindlings
looked over his players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sid Henderson?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got turned back in Latin at last class,&rdquo; volunteered
Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; added Joe Jackson, as if
he was an echo to his brother.</p>

<p>Sid came running up, all out of breath, buttoning
his blouse as he advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, son?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That rotten Latin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned Kindlings. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t slump
too often or you may put us in a hole. You aren&rsquo;t
the only first baseman that ever lived, but you&rsquo;re
pretty good, and I don&rsquo;t want to go to work training
you in and have you fired off the team by the
faculty for not keeping up your studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; promised Sid confidently,
and then the game started.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The &rsquo;varsity played snappy ball and the scrub
seemed a bit ragged, naturally perhaps as there was
less incentive for them to play hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brace up, fellows,&rdquo; implored Tom toward the
close of the game. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only four runs ahead
of us, and if we can knock out a couple of three-baggers
we&rsquo;ll throw a scare into them. They&rsquo;re
weak in right and left field. Soak the horsehide
toward either of the twins, but don&rsquo;t get it near
Phil Clinton. If he gets it within a foot of his
mitt, it&rsquo;s a goner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you wouldn&rsquo;t strike out more
men,&rdquo; said Fenton. &ldquo;My uncle says that when he
was a coach&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; yelled the umpire, and the reminiscence
was cut short.</p>

<p>The scrubs did &ldquo;take a brace&rdquo; and began finding
the curves of Langridge, much to that pitcher&rsquo;s
annoyance. Tom made a neat two-bagger, but died
on third, though the score was bettered in favor of
the scrub by two more runs.</p>

<p>Tom went to his box with a firm step and a more
certain feeling about his ability than he had ever
experienced before. He was sure he could strike
out at least two men, and he did so, including
Langridge and Holly Cross.</p>

<p>Holly, who was a good batter, was laughed at
by his chums.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do better than that,&rdquo; warned
Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do better yourself,&rdquo; retorted Holly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
want to hit it, anyhow. I was giving you an imitation
of how close I could come to it and miss it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those imitations don&rsquo;t do on this circuit,&rdquo;
added the tall Kindlings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty risky in a
game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, in a game,&rdquo; admitted Holly with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Tom gave one man a chance to walk and the
next popped out a fly that Dutch Housenlager
neatly gathered in. The game ended with no runs
for the &rsquo;varsity in the last inning and they had
beaten the scrub by only two runs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be worse,&rdquo; said Mr. Lighton grimly
as the teams filed off the diamond. &ldquo;It might be
worse, Woodhouse, but I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; admitted the captain gloomily.
&ldquo;We tackle Boxer Hall in the first of the league
series next week, and I think I&rsquo;ll have to make some
more shifts. What do you think of Langridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s all right&mdash;yet. If he doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
The coach stopped suddenly, seemed about to say
something and then evidently thought better of it.
&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;if worst comes to
worst, we can put Parsons in. He&rsquo;s improving
every day, and with a little more coaching so that
he isn&rsquo;t quite so awkward and can run better, he&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
make a star player. He&rsquo;ll be on the first team next
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to get on this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will,&rdquo; and with that the coach
walked off rather abruptly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>A GAME WITH BOXER HALL</h3>


<p>The grandstand was filled with cheering students.
In one section were the cohorts of Randall
College, led in giving their cries by &ldquo;Bean&rdquo; Perkins,
who had a voice like unto that of some fog horn.
There was a mass of glowing colors as flags and
streamers were waved in the wind.</p>

<p>In another part of the stand a smaller but no
less enthusiastic throng sent up exultant cries of
rivalry, calling out repeatedly: &ldquo;Boxer! Boxer!
Boxer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scattered among the students in each of the two
divisions of the stand were girls and more girls,
all of them pretty, at least in the eyes of their admirers,
and all of them sporting one college colors
or the other.</p>

<p>The bleachers were filled by ardent supporters
of the game who were not so particular about having
a roof over their heads and who, for one reason
or another, had to look to the difference in cost
between a grandstand ticket and one on the side
benches.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the occasion of the first regular game of
the season in the Tonoka Lake League between
Randall College and Boxer Hall. As the opposing
players came out for warm-up practice the yells,
cheers and cries were redoubled, and the stands
seemed a waving riot of colors, like some great
bed of flowers.</p>

<p>The sounds of balls impinging on thick mitts, of
willow bats cracking out hot liners or lofty flies
were heard all over the diamond. Never had the
grass seemed greener and never had the field
looked so inviting. It was a perfect day for the
game.</p>

<p>There was not a little anxiousness on the part
of the Randall players as they &ldquo;sized up&rdquo; their
opponents. They found them a sturdy lot of
youngsters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re playing snappy ball,&rdquo; observed Coach
Lighton to Captain Woodhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so will we,&rdquo; predicted Kindlings.
&ldquo;Just watch us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m out here. Now
let me give you and Langridge a few pointers,&rdquo;
and he called the pitcher to him, the three strolling
off to one side of the field.</p>

<p>Tom Parsons was on hand, and it does him no
discredit when it is stated that there was a feeling
of envy in his heart. But it was honest envy. He
wanted to get out on the diamond and do his share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in helping the Randall team to win. But he could
only look on and cheer with the others.</p>

<p>To win or lose the first game meant much to
either team. Not so much to Boxer Hall, perhaps,
as that team had run Fairview Institute a
close second for the championship, but to Randall
the winning of the game might put the necessary
&ldquo;snap&rdquo; into the lads, while to lose it might so discourage
them that it would be well on in the season
before they would &ldquo;take a brace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it is no wonder that there was a feeling of
nervousness on the part of the coach and the
players.</p>

<p>The practice was over. The preliminaries had
been arranged, the home team, Randall, having
the privilege of being last to bat. Langridge, with
final instructions from the coach, took his place in
the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; fairly howled the umpire, and the
game was on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ping!&rdquo; That was the sound of the bat colliding
with the ball, the first ball that Langridge threw.
Describing a graceful curve, the white sphere sailed
up into the air. Ed Kerr, hoping it might be a
foul, had thrown off his mask and was wildly looking
for it, but it was winging its way toward Jerry
Jackson in right field. A yell went up from the
two hundred college supporters of Boxer Hall, but
it was changed to a groan when one of the Jersey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
twins neatly gathered in the fly and put the runner
out. Langridge breathed a sigh of relief and
struck out the next two men.</p>

<p>Not a man got to first on the Randall team in
the initial inning. Kerr knocked a pop fly, but it
was caught by the pitcher, who repeated Langridge&rsquo;s
trick and sent the next two men to the
bench in short order.</p>

<p>The next three innings saw goose eggs in the
squares of both teams, the only hitting that was
done being foul tips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pitchers&rsquo; battle,&rdquo; began to be whispered
from seat to seat, and so it seemed. In the sixth
inning Randall succeeded in getting a man to first
on balls, and then began an attempt on the part of
the onlooking students of that college to get the
pitcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;goat,&rdquo; which, being interpreted, meant
to &ldquo;rattle&rdquo; him. That he had a &ldquo;glass arm&rdquo; was
the mildest epithet hurled at him, but Dave Ogden,
who was doing the twirling for Boxer Hall, only
smiled in a confident sort of way and struck out the
next man.</p>

<p>He was not so successful with Kindlings Woodhouse,
and the captain hammered out a pretty fly
that was good for two bases and sent Bricktop
Molloy to third. The Randall boys were rejoicing
now, for they saw a chance to score the first
run. And the run itself was brought in by the
blue-eyed and red-haired Molloy a moment later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
when Phil Clinton knocked a hot liner right between
the Boxer Hall shortstop and the third baseman.
But that ended the fun, though the score was
1 to 0 in favor of the home team.</p>

<p>This may have been an incentive to the visitors,
for straightway they began pounding Langridge,
and when the seventh inning ended the score was
4 to 2 in favor of Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;ve got to down &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said Woodhouse
fiercely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them put the game on
ice this way. Don&rsquo;t do it. Take a brace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the eighth inning it looked as if there was
going to be a slump in Randall stock. Langridge
seemed to go to pieces and issued walking passes
to two men, while he was batted for a two-bagger
and a three-base hit. But with a gritting
of their teeth the others rallied to his support, and
though the visitors tucked away two more runs,
making the score 6 to 2, at which their cohorts
went into a fine frenzy, that was all they could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, we&rsquo;re going to win!&rdquo; cried Captain
Paul, or &ldquo;Pinky&rdquo; Davenport, of the Boxers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, son,&rdquo; advised Kindlings dryly.</p>

<p>In the ending of the eighth there was a look of
&ldquo;do or die&rdquo; about the Randall players. Tom Parsons
felt himself gripping the sides of the seat
until the board hurt his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I could only get down there and play!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I? why can&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo; But he couldn&rsquo;t and he knew it.</p>

<p>Rather to their own surprise the Randall lads
began finding the ball with surprising regularity.
They batted it out &ldquo;for keeps,&rdquo; as Molloy said,
and they managed to tie the score. Then came the
ever nerve-thrilling ninth inning in a close game.
By great good luck, after he had given one man
his base on balls, Langridge retired a trio in one-two-three
order, and the score still stood a tie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, slam it into them. Wallop the
hide off &rsquo;em&mdash;sting &rsquo;em&mdash;souse &rsquo;em&mdash;put &rsquo;em in
brine for next year!&rdquo; implored Holly Cross. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
first up, and I&rsquo;m going to give you a correct imitation
of a man making a home run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he didn&rsquo;t. Holly struck out miserably and
he went away into a far corner and thought gloomy
thoughts. Not for long, however. A resounding
crack of the bat told him some one had knocked a
fly. It was Phil Clinton, and he started for first
like a deer with the hounds after it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, but he can run!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom in admiration.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he be fine covering the gridiron
with the ball tucked under his arm? Go on! go on!
That&rsquo;s the stuff, Phil! Pretty! pretty! That&rsquo;s a
beaut! that&rsquo;s a beaut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was on his feet yelling at the top of his
voice. So were hundreds of other lads and girls
also. But the Boxer third baseman was right near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the ball. He gathered it in and hurled it to first.
It would have been all over with Phil, in spite of
his magnificent run, except that the first baseman
missed it, and <a href="#image01">Phil, amid a riot of cheers, kept on
to second</a>.</p>

<p>That sealed the fate of the Boxers. They
&ldquo;slumped&rdquo; and went to pieces badly. The Randall
lads garnered a run and so they won the game&mdash;the
first of the season&mdash;by a score of 7 to 6.</p>

<p>And then what cheering there was!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3>A COIL OF WIRE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Bonfires to-night, fellows&mdash;bonfires multiplied
by seven and one more!&rdquo; cried Captain
Woodhouse as he gathered the victorious nine
about him and tried to hug each member. &ldquo;Well
played, my hearties! Yo ho! and a heave, yo ho!
You shall dine sumptuously this day, an it
please ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold hard there!&rdquo; came the laughing but calming
voice of the coach. &ldquo;No breaking of training
just because you&rsquo;ve won the first game. Not
much! You&rsquo;ve got to buckle down harder than
ever from now until school closes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even a cigarette?&rdquo; asked Holly Cross, with
a wink at his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or an ice cream soda?&rdquo; added Bricktop, his
blue eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; answered the coach with another
laugh, not taking the trouble to return an answer
to so obvious a question. &ldquo;They are going to
cheer you. Get ready to give them a yell in return.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The defeated team had gathered together.
There was an air of sullenness about the members
at losing the game, but this mood quickly passed
under the entreaties of Pinky Davenport, who was
a sportsman and &ldquo;a good loser,&rdquo; as he besought his
men to &ldquo;perk up and wallop &rsquo;em next time.&rdquo; He
called for three cheers for the victors, and they
were followed by the Boxer Hall yell.</p>

<p>Back came three ringing acclamations and a
&ldquo;tiger&rdquo; from Woodhouse and his mates, and their
yell, as weird a combination of words and syllables
as could well be devised, brought the whole concourse
of spectators standing up in acknowledgment.
Then came more cheering, and the nines
disappeared into the dressing-rooms beneath the
grandstand, while the crowds filed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Sid as he walked along with
Tom a little later, &ldquo;it was a glorious victory, as the
poem says. I don&rsquo;t exactly remember what it was
all about nor how we did it, but &lsquo;&rsquo;twas a glorious
victory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking,&rdquo; was Phil Clinton&rsquo;s opinion.
&ldquo;Eh, Tommy, my lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was rather silent. He had cheered the
nine until his throat ached, but somehow there was
to him a hollowness in the winning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad you couldn&rsquo;t play, old man,&rdquo; commented
Sid. &ldquo;I was almost hoping Langridge
would strain his arm, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad
luck, and, what&rsquo;s worse, Sid, it&rsquo;s treason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then give me liberty or buy me a seltzer lemonade,
Patrick Henry!&rdquo; declaimed Phil. &ldquo;Honest
now, Tom, weren&rsquo;t you just aching to get out and
play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; replied Tom so earnestly that the
others looked curiously at him. &ldquo;I never wanted
so much in my life to get into a game. Why, I&rsquo;d
even been glad to act as backstop. But it&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;It was a great game,
and maybe I&rsquo;ll have a chance to play next year if
I live that long,&rdquo; and he laughed, but there was no
mirth in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty pretty lot of girls at the game,&rdquo; observed
Sid, as if to change the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; agreed Tom, glad to get on a
more congenial topic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait until we play Fairview Institute,&rdquo; said
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; from Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s co-ed, you know&mdash;girl students as
well as boys. And, say, maybe there aren&rsquo;t some
stunners among &rsquo;em! They take in all the games
at home and some that aren&rsquo;t, and they have flags
and a yell of their own. They know how to yell,
too. I was over to a ball game there last year,
before I thought of coming to Randall, and say, it
was immense. There was one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, if it&rsquo;s about a girl,&rdquo; advised Sid.
&ldquo;When you get on the dame question, you don&rsquo;t
know where to stop. Sufficient to say that there
are some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then some more,&rdquo; added Phil. &ldquo;Wait
until we go there or they come here. Then you&rsquo;ll
see something worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the day come soon,&rdquo; spoke Tom with a
laugh. &ldquo;I sat next to a mighty pretty girl to-day
all right. She had a flag of Randall colors, and
when we won she waved it so hard she nearly put
my eye out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you made a fuss,&rdquo; said Phil with a
grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I turned to apologize and so did
she, and I knocked her hat all squeegee and she
blushed and I got red, and then&mdash;well, I up and
asked her if she had a brother at college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going some,&rdquo; commented Sid. &ldquo;What
did she say? Did you learn her name? Where
does she live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair and softly, little one,&rdquo; advised Tom, with
a sort of assumed superciliousness. &ldquo;Trust your
Uncle Dudley for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked on a few paces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; cried Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, provokingly mysterious
about it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on. Tell a fellow, do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;I saw her
walking off after the game with another fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded his two chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With him?&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, and there was a
new meaning in his tones. &ldquo;Who was the girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name was Madge Tyler,&rdquo; replied Tom
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madge Tyler!&rdquo; repeated Sid. &ldquo;Why, her
brother used to go here. He graduated two years
ago. He was a crackajack first baseman. And so
Madge Tyler is going with Langridge?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or he with her,&rdquo; said Tom dryly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see that it makes much difference. Why, hasn&rsquo;t he
got a right to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I s&rsquo;pose if you put it that way, he has,&rdquo;
went on Sid. &ldquo;Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only&mdash;nothing. Say, here&rsquo;s a chance to buy me
that seltzer lemonade. I think you ought to stand
treat for Phil and me, Tom, seeing that if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for us the game would have been lost and you
wouldn&rsquo;t have met Miss Madge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it has benefited me much,&rdquo;
replied Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you old cart horse?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Phil, thumping his friend on the back. &ldquo;Seeing the
game won or meeting the pretty girl? I believe
you said she was pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so, but she is&mdash;very. But I meant
about meeting her. Langridge seems to have a
mortgage in that direction, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He makes me sick!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;He and
the airs he gives himself. But come on in here,&rdquo; and
he turned toward a drug store. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like a lime
kiln, I&rsquo;m so warm. It&rsquo;s your treat, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Madge ask you to call?&rdquo; inquired
Phil as the three were wending their way toward
college again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! Well, it seems to me that
for a new acquaintance you rushed matters fairly
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot to add,&rdquo; said Tom slowly, &ldquo;that I
knew her before&mdash;back in Northville where I live.
She moved away from there some years ago and I
didn&rsquo;t recognize her at first. But she knew me at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! You old coffee percolator!&rdquo; shouted
Sid. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you dish that out to us first, instead
of letting us think you made an impression
simply by the aid of your manly figure? So you
knew her of old. Ha! ha! Likewise ho! ho! I
begin to smell a concealed rodent in the woodpile.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give me a chance,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s quiet
answer, and then he fell to talking about the game
until he and Sid got to their room. Later there
were bonfires and fun galore in honor of the victory.</p>

<p>Coach Lighton gave the nine no rest. Early the
next Monday afternoon, as soon as lessons were
over, he had them out on the diamond playing
against the scrub. Somewhat to the surprise of
members of the second team as well as that of the
&rsquo;varsity, Tom Parsons struck out an unusual number
of players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows will have to bat better than this,&rdquo;
growled Langridge when practice was over and the
&rsquo;varsity game had been saved merely by a fumble
on the part of a scrub fielder. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Physician, heal thyself,&rdquo; quoted Captain Woodhouse
with a grim smile. &ldquo;You struck out twice,
Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but batting isn&rsquo;t my best specialty
and it is for some of you fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; admitted Kindlings gravely,
&ldquo;and we must brace up a bit for the game next
Saturday with Fairview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain is right, boys,&rdquo; added the coach.
&ldquo;You must do some hard hitting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or else Tom Parsons mustn&rsquo;t pitch so well,&rdquo;
said Phil Clinton in a low voice to Sid. &ldquo;How
about it?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s improving wonderfully.
Langridge will have to look to his pitching arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the wealthy youth passed by
Phil and Sid. He heard what they said, and if
they could have seen his face then they would have
been somewhat puzzled at the look on it. But
neither Tom nor any of his friends saw.</p>

<p>It was the next day after the scrub game that as
Tom was alone in his room, &ldquo;boning&rdquo; away on
Latin, a knock sounded on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he cried, and, much to his surprise,
Langridge entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re becoming a regular greasy dig, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to do some studying, you know.
That&rsquo;s what I came here for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know and all that sort of thing, but if
you&rsquo;re going in for athletics you can&rsquo;t pound away
at your books too hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess what pounding I do won&rsquo;t hurt
me,&rdquo; and Tom laid aside the volume, the while
wondering why Langridge had called on him.
Tom distinctly was not in the rich youth&rsquo;s set.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; and the other&rsquo;s manner was becoming
more and more cordial. &ldquo;But I say, Parsons,
don&rsquo;t you want to help us get one in on the
sophs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. You can always count on me. What is
it this time?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know the little open pavilion down
near the river?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one near the boathouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know according to ancient and revered
college tradition that is sacred to the sophomores.
None other but members of the second-year
class may go there. If one of us freshmen is
caught there it means a ducking, to say the least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Kerr and I were in there the other day,
for we heard that the sophs were off on a little
racket, and we didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be disturbed. We
had a couple of girls there and were having a little
confab when along came Gladdus and Battersby,
grabbed us before we knew it and chucked us into
the H<sub>2</sub>O, whence we floundered like drowned rats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did the whole college, I guess. Now Kerr
and I feel that not only have we been insulted, but
that the whole freshman class has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you help us to get even?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. What you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see later. What I need now is a coil of
wire. I want to know if you&rsquo;ll get it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, but why can&rsquo;t you get it for yourself?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve got about all
the marks I can stand this term, and merely because
I happened to play an innocent trick in class to-day
I&rsquo;m forbidden to leave the college grounds for
a week. Just when I want to go to town, too. So
I&rsquo;ve got to get some one else to get the wire for me,
and I thought you would. I&rsquo;ll pay for it, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; agreed Tom, not stopping to
think that Kerr, the special chum of Langridge,
might have acted for his friend. &ldquo;What kind do
you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. Here&rsquo;s the money,&rdquo; and Langridge
handed over a bill, also giving Tom a memorandum
of the kind of wire wanted and where to
get it in Haddonfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one more thing,&rdquo; the other youth added as
he prepared to take his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, for the life of you, tell a soul that you
got the wire for me. I want it kept a dead secret.
The trick will be all the better then. Will you
promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On your honor as a freshman of Randall College?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom wondered at the other&rsquo;s insistence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. Shall I swear?&rdquo; and Tom
laughed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your word is enough,&rdquo; spoke Langridge
significantly. &ldquo;Have the wire by to-night, and
we&rsquo;ll teach the sophs a lesson they won&rsquo;t soon forget.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3>AN ELECTRIC SHOCK</h3>


<p>Late that same afternoon Tom, having gone to
town alone, that he might accomplish his mission
unobserved, came back with a coil of telegraph
wire concealed under his sweater at his waist. He
smuggled it to Langridge&rsquo;s room without being
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, old man,&rdquo; cried Langridge
heartily, but there was an air of patronizing superiority
in his manner that Tom did not like. Still, he
reasoned, the other could not rid himself of an inborn
habit so easily, and it really seemed, in spite
of the fact that Tom might be regarded as a rival
of Langridge, that the latter was doing his best to
be friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it wouldn&rsquo;t do to ask what&rsquo;s up, would
it?&rdquo; inquired Tom as he was about to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied Langridge with what he
meant to be a genial smile. &ldquo;It might get out, you
know. But you can be in at the death, so to speak.
The whole freshman class will assemble at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
boathouse about nine. There&rsquo;ll be a full moon
and we can have a good view of the sophs&rsquo; pavilion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they going to be there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. In fact I&rsquo;m counting on it. This
is the night of their annual moonlight song festival.
They gather in and about the pavilion and
make the night hideous with snatches of melody.
They&rsquo;re rotten singers&mdash;the sophs this year&mdash;but
that is neither here nor there. The point is that
they&rsquo;ll be there, and it&rsquo;s up to us freshmen to give
&rsquo;em a little surprise party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re going to arrange the wire so
they can&rsquo;t get into the pavilion without cutting it,&rdquo;
suggested Tom, &ldquo;or else put it across the path to
trip them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;yes&mdash;something like that,&rdquo; replied Langridge
hastily. &ldquo;Oh, by the way, have you a knife?
I lost mine out rowing the other day. I&rsquo;ll give it
back to you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom passed over his knife, a good-sized one,
with his name engraved on the handle. His father
had given it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;I think a great
deal of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; promised Langridge. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t
forget to be on hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there to see the fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And maybe you&rsquo;ll see more than you bargain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
for,&rdquo; whispered Langridge as Tom went out.
There was a curious look on the face of the &rsquo;varsity
pitcher.</p>

<p>One by one, by twos and threes or in small
groups, silent figures stole away from dormitories
that night and gathered about the pavilion or the
boathouse, which was not far from it. To the
first place went the sophomores, bent on having
their annual frolic of song. To the second rendezvous
traveled the freshmen, but they went more
silently, for they did not want their natural enemies
to learn of their presence.</p>

<p>The sophomores, however, were on their guard.
From time immemorial it had been the custom for
the first-year class to endeavor to break up the
song fest of their predecessors, and it was the
function of the first years to do this in as novel a
manner as possible.</p>

<p>Tradition had it that various methods had been
used, such as setting fire to the pavilion, digging
pits in the paths that led to it and covering the
holes with leaves and grass, laying a line of hose
to the place, so that at an opportune moment the
singers would be drenched and routed. The latter
was a favorite plan and most successful.</p>

<p>But to-night a more strict guard than usual had
been kept over the battle-scarred pavilion. All
that day a committee had been on the watch so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that it was thought impossible that any hose could
be used or any pits dug.</p>

<p>Now the sophomores were beginning to gather
in and around the small shelter. They were jubilant,
for they began to think they had outwitted
their never-ceasing enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the freshmen were not idle. In large
numbers they had quietly gathered at the boathouse,
in the dark shadows of which they remained in hiding,
waiting for the opening of the singing and the
consequent breaking up of the sophomore body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; asked Sid of Tom as those
two and Phil Clinton made their way to the rendezvous.
&ldquo;Water pipes, fire or something brand
new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can search me,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s non-committal
answer. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s something new. There
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any provisions for a bonfire and
none of us swiped the fire hose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge and his committee have it in
charge,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some secrecy about
it, and very properly, too. Last year, I understand,
it leaked out and the fun was spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom did not reply, but he wondered what use
Langridge was going to make of the wire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They ought to start soon now,&rdquo; whispered
Phil. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good crowd of them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they&rsquo;ve got scouts out all around,&rdquo;
added Sid as he and his chums saw a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
shadowy figures patroling the stretch around the
pavilion. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not going to be caught unawares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re going to break &rsquo;em up,&rdquo;
remarked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge,
who was moving about among the freshmen. &ldquo;Say,
Ed, you&rsquo;d better go now and light the fuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it an explosion?&rdquo; asked Sid eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better be careful,&rdquo; cautioned Phil.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s heart was thumping. He began to see
the use to which the wire might be put, and he was
afraid lest he had taken part in some dangerous
prank. If Langridge had planned to explode a
mine under the pavilion, some one might be injured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no explosion, only an explosion of
wrath pretty soon,&rdquo; replied Langridge. &ldquo;Go ahead,
Kerr. Let &rsquo;em sing one song and they&rsquo;ll think
we&rsquo;ve called it off. Then let it go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kerr hurried off, keeping in the shadows. No
sooner had he started than a movement was noticeable
among the sophomores, groups of whom
could easily be seen now, as the moon was well up.</p>

<p>Then, on the stillness of the night, there broke
a song. It was an old melody, sacred to Randall,
and, in spite of being rendered by hilarious students,
it was well done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not half bad,&rdquo; commented Phil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got some good members for the glee
club there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s punk!&rdquo; sneered Langridge. &ldquo;Wait until
we have a song fest. We&rsquo;ll make them feel sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The melody continued, and coming as it did
from the distance, while all about was the wondrous
beauty of the moon, the effect produced on
Tom Parsons was one of distinct pleasure. It was
like being at some play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;to spoil it all!
What brutes we college fellows are&mdash;sometimes. I
like to listen to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The song was softer now, and then it broke forth
into a full chorus, well rendered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to break it up,&rdquo; reasoned Tom.
Then a class feeling overcame him. After all, the
sophomores were their traditional enemies, and
college tradition demanded that they disperse the
gathering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kerr ought to be there now,&rdquo; whispered Langridge.
&ldquo;The fuse will burn for two minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fuse&mdash;fuse,&rdquo; repeated Phil. &ldquo;It <i>must</i> be an
explosion. You want to be careful, Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;But mind now, no squealing, whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s quick retort.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Randall College freshmen,&rdquo; as if that was
all that was necessary.</p>

<p>Kerr glided in from somewhere.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sophomores had started another song.
They were about through the second verse when
there came a series of sudden yells from the pavilion.
There were cries of pain, and Langridge,
in the midst of the freshmen, called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s the stuff! Rah! rah! sophs!
This time we break you up. Cheer, boys, cheer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The freshmen set up an exultant cry as it became
evident that, in some way, the gleeful singing
of the second-year lads had been stopped. There
was an excited movement in the pavilion, yet the
waiting freshmen could not see that anything had
taken place.</p>

<p>Then came a cry&mdash;two exclamations&mdash;louder
and more anguished than any that had preceded.
There was a yell&mdash;a protesting yell&mdash;and then
some one in the pavilion shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it, fellows! The hand railing is charged
with electricity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the freshmen!&rdquo; called Langridge,
and the response came spontaneously, for his
mates knew that they had triumphed over the
sophomores.</p>

<p>Suddenly above the confused cheering and shouting
there came another cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me, fellows! Oh, help&mdash;help!&rdquo; screamed
some one inside the pavilion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a confused movement among the
singers. Something seemed to have happened&mdash;something
serious. The freshmen stopped their
cheering and crowded up. A big sophomore broke
through the throng and dashed toward the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; called Tom, and he had
an uneasy feeling as he asked the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter? It&rsquo;s you confounded freshmen, that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter! Gladdus and Battersby have
been knocked unconscious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unconscious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, by a powerful current of electricity. Get
out of my way, fresh, or I&rsquo;ll knock you down! I&rsquo;m
going for a doctor. Some of you had better notify
the proctor,&rdquo; he added to a few of his classmates
who followed him on the run. &ldquo;This is serious
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; advised Langridge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all right. We broke up the pavilion meeting all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But maybe some one is seriously hurt,&rdquo; said Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, it was only a current from the incandescent
light lamps. It couldn&rsquo;t hurt them. Come
on, take a sneak away from here. We&rsquo;ve had our
fun. And mind, everybody keep his mouth shut,&rdquo;
and Langridge disappeared in the shadows of the
trees, while ahead of him panted several sophomores
on their way to summon a physician.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3>TOM DOESN&rsquo;T TELL</h3>


<p>Tom and Sid hurried along in the midst of the
freshmen, Phil Clinton trailing after them. The
three found themselves in a little group, comparatively
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better do something,&rdquo; proposed
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, best not to interfere,&rdquo; advised Sid. &ldquo;Let
them manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if Gladdus and Battersby are hurt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re likely to be
caught any minute. Proc. Zane will be out after
all that racket. Let&rsquo;s get to our rooms and lay
low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Tom and Sid were in their apartment the
scrub pitcher turned to his chum and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know what was in the wind to-night,
Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I left it all to Langridge and Kerr. But
I guess it&rsquo;s all right. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing much. But if some one is
hurt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, don&rsquo;t worry. Why, that&rsquo;s nothing
to what other classes have done. I remember hearing
a story of how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sid&rsquo;s yarn was interrupted by a tap at the
door, and Ford Fenton slid in. There was rather
a frightened look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Fenton?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but something is. They&rsquo;ve carried
Gladdus and Battersby into the infirmary, and
there&rsquo;s a lot of scurrying about. They&rsquo;ve sent for
a doctor from town, and Moses and Proc. Zane
have gone down to the pavilion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I know. Say, but we broke up their
singing all right, didn&rsquo;t we? It was great. My
uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Tom, and there was such unusual
irritability in his tone that the other two
looked at him in surprise. He saw it and went
on: &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t exactly mean that, Fenton, old
chap, but I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m all upset.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For cats&rsquo; sake, what about?&rdquo; demanded Sid.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re worried because our
class knocked out a couple of greasy old sophs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came another interruption, and a lad entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Snail,&rdquo; exclaimed Sid as Sam Looper
crawled in and closed the door softly behind him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
&ldquo;He can find out what&rsquo;s up. How about it, Snail&mdash;any
news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sam blinked his eyes as if the light hurt him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been around&mdash;around,&rdquo; he said slowly,
waving his hand to take in the whole compass of
the college and grounds. &ldquo;I saw &rsquo;em carry the two
sophs away. They&rsquo;re badly burned and shocked.
Langridge is a fool!&rdquo; They had seldom seen the
Snail so excited. &ldquo;He went and strung a wire from
the electric light circuit to the iron hand rail around
the pavilion. Only he made a mistake in the connections
and got the wires crossed with the powerful
arc circuit. The incandescent is only a hundred
and ten volts, while the arc is twenty-four hundred.
Some difference. Only that they got a small part of
it, they&rsquo;d be dead instead of merely badly shocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Parsons half uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Sid quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Go on, Snail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all,&rdquo; came from Sam. &ldquo;Pitchfork&mdash;he&rsquo;s
a sort of doctor, you know&mdash;he&rsquo;s working
over &rsquo;em now. I guess they&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom started to leave the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out. I&mdash;I must see what&rsquo;s happened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stay here!&rdquo; ordered Sid, half fiercely.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be nabbed in a minute. Proc. Zane has his
scouts out, waiting to corral everybody. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Snail, you go. You know how to keep out of
sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Sam, who liked nothing better
than to prowl around in the dark. &ldquo;Wait here and
I&rsquo;ll sneak back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; cautioned Ford.</p>

<p>The Snail slowly winked his half-shut eyes, but
did not speak. Then he closed the door softly and
they heard him tiptoeing down the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Snail will find out,&rdquo; almost whispered Sid.
Somehow they all appeared to be under a strain.
Tom was pacing back and forth in the room. Ford
stood with his back to the mantel, his hands clasped
behind him. Sid tried to look at a book, but he
took no sense of the words. Finally, with an exclamation,
he threw it on the sofa. Ford quietly
left the room and a little later Phil Clinton came
in. Sid and Tom saw that he had heard all.</p>

<p>Tom ceased his nervous walk and went over to
the sofa. He sat down on it, the ancient piece of
furniture creaking with his weight. But he was not
there half a minute before he arose and began pacing
up and down again. Then he tried an easy
chair, whence there floated up a little cloud of dust
from the old cushions. There was silence in the
apartment, broken only by the ticking of a fussy
little alarm clock. It seemed to double up on the
number of seconds allotted to a minute. The three
could hear each other&rsquo;s breathing. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
under some strain, though, for the life of them,
neither Sid nor Phil could tell what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t some one say something?&rdquo; asked
Phil at length, and it was as if some one had broken
the silence in a church.</p>

<p>Sid picked up the book he had cast aside. Then
he threw it down again, for there sounded the noise
of a person coming along the corridor. The Snail
came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; gasped Tom, and it was as if he had
shouted it, though he spoke in a low, tense voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in a bad way,&rdquo; said the Snail slowly,
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a chance to pull them through.
There&rsquo;s going to be an investigation, I heard.
Langridge is likely to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a knock on the door. The lads
started guiltily. Phil, being nearest the portal,
opened it, though if it was one of the proctor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;scouts,&rdquo; as was likely, he would be &ldquo;up&rdquo; for
breaking one of the college rules about being in
another room after the prescribed hours. It was a
&ldquo;scout,&rdquo; Mr. Snell, a sort of upper janitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parsons,&rdquo; said the scout deferentially&mdash;and
he took no notice of the presence of the Snail or
Phil, for which they were duly grateful&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Parsons, the proctor would like to see you in his
office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; asked Tom, and his heart began to beat
double strokes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a look at his chums Tom went out and
to the office. He was afraid lest he might betray
the secret he feared would be disclosed at any
moment&mdash;the secret of the coil of wire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parsons,&rdquo; began Proctor Zane slowly when
the door had closed behind Tom, &ldquo;there has been
a serious accident to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom bowed. He could not trust his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two students were badly hurt and the results
may be lasting. They are only just now out of
danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more Tom bowed. He could not speak.
The beating of his heart was choking him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; went on the proctor judicially, &ldquo;I
take no notice of the&mdash;er&mdash;the affairs between the
different classes or student bodies. But this time I
am obliged to. Dr. Churchill and myself have
made an examination of the pavilion where this
outrage occurred. We discovered the wires running
from the electric light circuit to the hand rail.
We discovered where a spring connection had been
made, so that, by the burning away of a fuse, the
parts of the spring closed, the wires came in contact
and the current filled the hand rail. We also discovered
something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, and Tom, for the first time, looked
the proctor full in the face. Mr. Zane held out a
small object.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This knife was found near where the wires were
fastened to the railing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It has your
name on it. Is it yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You took part in this affair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a freshman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is answer enough. Did you attach the
wires?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I had nothing to do with that part
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your knife would seem to indicate that you
had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer from Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you use your knife to attach the wires?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom could almost hear his heart beating. There
was a singing in his ears. Then he answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I cannot tell, Mr. Zane. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the proctor gravely. &ldquo;I did
not expect you would tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom turned and made his way from the room.
There was a mist before his eyes. There came
back to him the promise he had made to Langridge.
On his honor as a freshman he had agreed not to
give information. When he gave the promise he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
had not known how serious it would be. But,
nevertheless, it was a promise.</p>

<p>Tom stumbled into his room. The Snail and
Phil were gone. Sid sat with the light turned low.
He jumped up as his chum came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the answer in a dull, spiritless
tone. Tom threw himself into a chair. The fussy
little clock ticked away. Half an hour passed and
not a word was spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go to bed, old man,&rdquo; said Sid
gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word Tom began to undress. The
light was turned out. Sid was dozing off when he
heard his chum tossing restlessly on his bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; he called through the darkness, &ldquo;can I
help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came the answer, and then Tom lay quiet.
But he did not sleep.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3>A GIRL AND A GAME</h3>


<p>There was a more complete investigation the
next day. The report was also circulated that the
two sophomores were not so badly injured as had
at first been feared. But there was something in
the air which showed that stringent measures were
likely to be taken by the faculty.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill was ten minutes late in opening
chapel that morning, and there was much stately
moving to and fro on the part of the instructors.
On the face of Professor Emerson Tines there was
a look of satisfaction, as if he was glad that some
one had gotten into trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at Pitchfork!&rdquo; said Sid to Tom, but
Tom&rsquo;s face had not lost its anxious look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, cheer up!&rdquo; whispered Phil
Clinton. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think you did the whole business
if they see your face, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill made an unusual prayer that
morning. Though he did not directly refer to the
happening of the previous night, it was in his petition,
and many a freshman, impressed by the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
words, then and there resolved to abjure in
the future unseemly pranks and to become a
&ldquo;grind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The freshman class will remain after chapel this
morning,&rdquo; announced the venerable head of Randall,
and as the other classes filed out there were
commiserating looks cast at the unlucky first-years
by the juniors and seniors and vindictive glances
bestowed by the sophomores.</p>

<p>The examination was a long and searching one.
Tom was questioned at length, but all he would
admit was that he took part in the affair, though he
stated that he had had nothing to do with fixing
the wires. Nor did he tell of having brought the
coil to Langridge. His knife was damaging evidence
against him, and he was content to let it
stand as such. Kerr manfully admitted lighting
the fuse which sprung the wires together and sent
the current sizzling into the hand rail, but he would
go no further nor tell who had strung the conductors.</p>

<p>The faculty dismissed the class and the instructors
went into executive session.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll all be in for it,&rdquo; predicted Phil as
the lads strolled off to their classrooms. &ldquo;They
may suspend us all for a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d do that,&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s opinion.
&ldquo;They may forbid any of us taking part in
athletics, though.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they might do that,&rdquo; added Fenton. &ldquo;My
uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys all stopped and looked at him. No one
spoke a word. Fenton squirmed under their unflinching
gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well,&rdquo; he began hesitatingly, &ldquo;he ought
to know, for he was a coach here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re a regular trolley car, with an
automatic gong that rings up the same thing every
time,&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t dare
keep us out of athletics for such a little joke as that.
Why, the whole student body would be up in arms.
The ball team would go to pieces, and we&rsquo;d lose the
championship. They wouldn&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad you think so,&rdquo; remarked Holly Cross
calmly. &ldquo;But I can see us giving a good imitation
of a lot of fellows in trouble. Maybe we&mdash;that is,
whoever strung those wires, for I don&rsquo;t know who
it was&mdash;maybe we went a little too far. If I&rsquo;d have
known what was up, I&rsquo;d have made a kick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; sneered Langridge. But he
did not admit his part in the prank and he let Tom
suffer for him, for that afternoon it was announced
that Tom was to be suspended for two weeks and
Kerr for three. Every other member of the freshman
class was barred from leaving the college
grounds for a week.</p>

<p>There arose a mighty protest over this, for there
was a game scheduled with Fairview Institute at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the end of the week, and if the class was kept within
bounds it meant that many of the nine could not
play and that all the freshmen would be barred
from witnessing the second of the championship
struggles, as the contest was to take place at Fairview.</p>

<p>Then the faculty reconsidered the matter, being
&ldquo;almost human,&rdquo; as Phil said, and, with the possible
exception of Professor Tines, having once
been young and fond of sport themselves. They
made a new ruling: That the class was to keep
within bounds until the day of the game, when all
would be allowed to attend save Tom and Kerr.
In their case no exception would be made.</p>

<p>There was more objecting, but the ruling stood.
It meant that Tom could not pitch on the scrub and
that Kerr could not catch on the &rsquo;varsity, whereat
there was much anguish of soul, for the Fairview
team was a hard proposition, and it would take the
best that was in the Randall lads to beat them. But
there was no help for it.</p>

<p>Nor did Tom reproach Langridge for having
gotten him into the trouble. Tom had hoped that
his rival would confess and shoulder the blame, in
which case, merely having brought the wire on a
supposition that it was to be used for a comparatively
harmless prank, Tom&rsquo;s case would not have
been nearly so bad. But Langridge said nothing.
Sid heard somehow of the &rsquo;varsity pitcher&rsquo;s part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the trick. Then Tom&rsquo;s chum expressed the belief
that Langridge had deliberately acted so as to get
Tom into trouble because the rich lad had feared
the newcomer might supplant him as pitcher.</p>

<p>But Tom would not hear of this. He took his
suspension grimly, silently, and though barred from
class, he kept up his studies; nor did he neglect his
practice of throwing curves, Kerr gladly agreeing
to catch for him, for the two were outcasts from
the diamond, Tom not even being allowed to play
on the scrub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But two weeks and three weeks can&rsquo;t last forever,&rdquo;
declared Kerr, &ldquo;though I sure would like to
see the Fairview game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saturday came and with it a feeling of apprehension
on the part of the Randall students, for various
reports had come to them of the prowess of their
rivals. The team made ready to depart for Fairview
Institute. They were to go by rail to the college
that was fifteen miles away. Tom and Kerr,
about the only ones in the athletic set who remained
at Randall, looked wistfully at their departing comrades.</p>

<p>And then, so suddenly that it seemed like a
miracle, their sorrow was turned to joy, for the
proctor sought them out on the campus, where the
team was being cheered previous to departure, and
announced in the case of the two suspended students
that they might go to the game, but take no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
part, even in an emergency. They gladly accepted
the terms. Dr. Churchill&rsquo;s heart had softened at
the last moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls, girls, girls!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom as he
walked out on the field with Sid and Phil and saw
the grandstand at Fairview massed with gay femininity.
&ldquo;And all pretty too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Sid. &ldquo;What did I tell you?
But what interests me more is the other team.
Jove! but they are quick,&rdquo; for the Fairview students
were batting and catching in a manner to provoke
admiration.</p>

<p>There were shrill cries of encouragement from
the girls and more hoarse shouts from the male
students, for at Fairview the sexes were about
evenly divided, both boys and girls taking equal
interest in sports.</p>

<p>Coach Lighton shook his head dubiously as he
saw the Randall boys stream out on the diamond
for practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Cross will appreciate the seriousness of
the matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t begin to touch
Kerr at catching, yet he&rsquo;s the best one we can
put in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Kindlings. &ldquo;But maybe we&rsquo;ll
make out. I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kerr was as nervous as a girl at not being able to
play. He paced up and down the coaching lines
until Kindlings, fearing he would disconcert the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
team, sent him to the grandstand, where Tom had
already gone.</p>

<p>Well, that game with Fairview is ancient history
now. Sufficient to say that after a good beginning,
when they gathered three runs the first inning and
held their opponents down to a goose egg, principally
through the pitching of Langridge, the Randall
lads went to pieces and the Fairviews ran away
with them. Langridge was finally fairly batted out
of the box and the final score was 16 to 4 in favor
of the co-educational institution.</p>

<p>It was a sorely disappointed nine that filed off
the diamond, nor could the generous cheers of the
victors apply any balm to the wounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such pitching!&rdquo; grumbled Phil as he was in the
dressing-room. &ldquo;That lost us the game as much
as anything else. Langridge didn&rsquo;t seem to be in
form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pitcher overheard him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Clinton,&rdquo; he called out sneeringly, &ldquo;you
mind your own affairs. I train as good as you, and
I didn&rsquo;t miss a fly that came right into my hands,&rdquo;
for Phil had thus offended, letting in a run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you pitch better,&rdquo; spoke Sid quietly,
for he and several others were &ldquo;sore&rdquo; at Langridge,
who plainly enough had not been in his usual good
form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe. I can&rsquo;t be on edge all the while,&rdquo;
and the pitcher laughed nervously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom, in the grandstand, was making his way
down amid a bevy of pretty girls and wishing he
had some one who would introduce him to them
when he heard a voice call his name. He turned
quickly and saw Madge Tyler in a bewilderingly
pretty dress, her hair framing her face in a most
bewitching manner, while her eyes were bright with
the joy of youth and the fire thereof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked sympathetically,
holding out her hand to Tom. &ldquo;I was so sorry for
Mr. Langridge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Langridge?&rdquo; asked Tom quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, because the pitcher seems to have to
work so hard, and then to be defeated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was unpleasant&mdash;the defeat,&rdquo; agreed
Tom. &ldquo;But are you going out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I came over with friends to see the game,
but I seem to have missed them in the crush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let me be your escort back to Haddonfield?&rdquo;
asked Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather by my lonesome,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you. I dare say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused and looked over the moving mass of
students, boys and girls who were laughing happily
or walking away dejectedly according to the colors
they wore. Tom followed her gaze. He saw
Langridge approaching and he knew that Miss
Tyler had seen him also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr. Langridge!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wonder how he feels? He promised to meet me
after the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom took a sudden resolve. He did not stop to
think that it might be a foolish one. He was actuated
solely by what he argued to himself was a
platonic interest in the pretty girl at his side. He
had known her in childhood, he knew her people,
and they were old friends of his folks. Of late
Tom had heard certain rumors about Langridge,
nothing serious as rumors about college students
go, but enough to make Tom glad that, in the case
of his sisters, Langridge could not get to know
them. It was therefore with somewhat the same
feeling that he might have warned his sisters that
he spoke to Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Mr. Langridge are quite friendly,&rdquo;
he said in what he intended to be a light tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; came the frank answer. &ldquo;I like him
immensely. I like all college boys&mdash;when they&rsquo;re
nice,&rdquo; she finished with a little laugh.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s face was grave, and she saw it. With a
girl&rsquo;s intuition she felt that there was something in
the air, and, girl-like, she wanted to know what it
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I like him?&rdquo; she demanded with an
arch look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;no, Miss Madge!&rdquo; burst
out Tom, speaking more loudly than he had intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind me speaking about it,
for I&rsquo;ve known you so many years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so ancient as all that!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl rather pertly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Tom, and he felt that he was
getting into deep water and beyond his depth.
But he would not retreat and floundered on: &ldquo;No,
but I&mdash;I know your folks wouldn&rsquo;t like you to go
with Langridge&mdash;that is, too much, you know. He
does not bear a very good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hand on Tom&rsquo;s shoulder, and he
felt himself wheeled suddenly around, to be confronted
by Langridge. The pitcher had brushed
his uniform and looked particularly handsome in a
well-fitting suit, while there was a healthy glow to
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better repeat over again, Parsons,&rdquo;
he said somewhat sternly, &ldquo;what you were
just saying to Miss Tyler about me. I didn&rsquo;t catch
it all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Tom was choking, and the
girl bravely came to his relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just talking about you,&rdquo; she admitted
with a nervous little laugh. &ldquo;I was saying how disheartening
it must be to pitch through a hard game
and then lose it. And Tom&mdash;I mean Mr. Parsons,
but I always call him Tom, for I&rsquo;ve known him so
long&mdash;he was just saying&mdash;er&mdash;he was just saying
that you were rather&mdash;well, rather a flirt. I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that was it, wasn&rsquo;t it, Tom?&rdquo; and she looked
quickly at him, but there was meaning in her glance.</p>

<p>Langridge kept his hand on Tom&rsquo;s shoulder and
the two looked each other straight in the face unflinchingly.
Miss Tyler lost some of her blushes
and her cheeks began to pale. Then Tom spoke
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to know exactly what I said,&rdquo; was
his quiet but tense answer, &ldquo;I will tell you&mdash;later,&rdquo;
and he swung on his heel and started down the
grandstand steps.</p>

<p>For an instant Langridge stared after him.
Then, with a little laugh, he turned to Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Parsons is sore because he&rsquo;s been suspended,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t even pitch on the
scrub. But how pretty you&rsquo;re looking to-day, Miss
Madge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Tyler, please,&rdquo; she corrected him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I even call you Miss Madge after I&rsquo;ve
been defeated in the game?&rdquo; he pleaded, and he
looked at her boldly. &ldquo;It would be&mdash;er&mdash;well,
sort of soothing to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it?&rdquo; and she laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It surely would,&rdquo; and he bent closer toward
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you may&mdash;but only on occasions of
defeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to lose every game,&rdquo; he added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
promptly as he turned at her side and walked down
the steps.</p>

<p>Tom Parsons, strolling alone over the now
vacant diamond, saw them together, and there was
a strange feeling in his heart.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3>TOM&rsquo;S CURVES</h3>


<p>There was lively practice of the Randall nine
the following week, and Coach Lighton said some
things that hurt, but they were needed. Nor was
Langridge spared, though he affected not to mind
the sharp admonition that he must pitch more consistently.</p>

<p>The nine played a game Saturday with an outside
team, more for practice than anything else, and
won it &ldquo;hands down,&rdquo; as Holly Cross said. But,
after all, it was not much credit to the &rsquo;varsity, for
their opponents were not as good as the college
scrub. Holly caught, the period of Kerr&rsquo;s suspension
not being up yet.</p>

<p>Tom kept at his practice, but he was more than
glad when he could resume his class work again
and take his place on the second nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll tackle work together,&rdquo; said the
coach one afternoon to Tom, for Mr. Lighton had
not been allowed to give him directions during the
suspension weeks. &ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t gone stale,
Parsons.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not. Kerr and I have been sort of practicing
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. I hope, before the season is over,
that you and he will go into a regular game together.
If not, you&rsquo;ll have your &lsquo;innings&rsquo; next
year, if you progress as you have been doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was glad of the praise, but he would have
been more glad of a chance to get on the &rsquo;varsity.
Still he determined to do his best on the scrub, but
it was hard and rather thankless work.</p>

<p>Mr. Lighton put him through a hard course of
&ldquo;sprouts&rdquo; that afternoon. With some members of
the scrub to bat against him, Tom sent in swift
and puzzling balls, for all the while his ability to
curve was increasing and his control was improving.
That afternoon he struck out six men in succession,
retiring them without having given any
one of them more than two balls. It was very
good work, and the fact that the men were not
extraordinary good hitters did not detract from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; cried Mr. Lighton enthusiastically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But what he was
going to do he did not say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They ought to make you substitute pitcher on
the &rsquo;varsity team,&rdquo; was the opinion of Dutch Housenlager
when the practice was over. &ldquo;Rod Evert
isn&rsquo;t one-two-six with you, and he doesn&rsquo;t do any
practicing to speak of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he feels that he doesn&rsquo;t have to, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Langridge seems to make good nearly every time,&rdquo;
spoke Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, rats! All that keeps Langridge manager
is his money. He certainly runs the financial end
of the game to perfection. And if he wasn&rsquo;t manager
he wouldn&rsquo;t be pitcher. But the fellows know
he takes a lot of responsibility from them, and
they&rsquo;re just easy enough to let things slide. Some
day we&rsquo;ll be up against it. Langridge will be
knocked out of the box, Evert won&rsquo;t be in form,
and we&rsquo;ll lose the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless they call on &lsquo;yours truly,&rsquo;&rdquo; interjected
Tom with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed Dutch seriously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my
point. I wish they&rsquo;d name you for sub. I&rsquo;m going
to ask&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; expostulated Tom quickly. &ldquo;If I
can&rsquo;t get there on my own merits, I don&rsquo;t want it.
No favors, please. I can wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just as you say, of course. But say,
there&rsquo;s the Grasshopper. Watch me make him
jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed to Pete Backus, a tall student, who
seemed to be measuring off a certain distance on a
grassy stretch down near the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks as if he was going to jump without you
making him,&rdquo; observed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s always jumping. He thinks he&rsquo;s
great at it. Wants to make the track team, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t seem to do it. He&rsquo;ll do his distance easily
one day and fall down the next. You can&rsquo;t depend
on him. But I&rsquo;ll make him jump now.
Sneak down behind those bushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom followed Dutch softly. There were no
other students about and they managed to gain
the screen of the bushes unobserved by the Grasshopper,
who was intent on measuring distances
with a pocket tape. The two conspirators could
see where he had been practicing the broad jump.</p>

<p>The Grasshopper stood close to a clump of elder
bushes, with his back to them. He was preparing
for another test. Dutch Housenlager, who was
not happy unless he was engaged in some joke or
horse play, silently cut a long pole and fastened to
it a big pin, which he extracted from some part of
his garments. Then, seeing a good opening that
gave access to a tender part of the rear elevation
of the Grasshopper&rsquo;s legs, he thrust with no gentle
hand just as poor Pete was about to throw himself
forward in a standing broad jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; cried the punctured one.</p>

<p>But it was so sudden that he did not have time to
stop his leap, which he was on the verge of making,
and he sprang through the air like an animated
jumping-jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! fine!&rdquo; cried Dutch, rising up from his
place of concealment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time you beat
your own record, Grasshopper.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Pete turned. He looked over the space he had
covered. His heels had come down at least a foot
beyond where he had previously landed. The look
of anger on his face, as he felt of his pricked leg,
turned to one of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I have done better by&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&rdquo;&mdash;and he measured
it&mdash;&ldquo;by fourteen inches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; called Dutch, still laughing.
&ldquo;Next time you want to jump, just let me get in
the bushes behind you. It&rsquo;ll be good for an extra
foot every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; murmured the Grasshopper, still rubbing
his leg reflectively. &ldquo;It was an awful jab though,
Dutch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it? Look at your distance,&rdquo; and
once more Pete looked happy as he again measured
the space he had covered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old Grasshopper,&rdquo; commented Dutch as
he and Tom strolled along the campus, leaving the
jumper still at his practice. &ldquo;Poor old Grasshopper!
He&rsquo;ll never make the track team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next few days saw Tom putting in all his
spare time practicing curves under the watchful eye
of Mr. Lighton. The &rsquo;varsity played with the
scrub and narrowly escaped a good drubbing.
Langridge seemed to be asleep part of the time
and issued a number of walking papers. It was
after the contest, which the regulars had pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
out of the fire with rather scorched fingers, that
the coach called Captain Woodhouse and Langridge
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think we&rsquo;d better make a little shift,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; asked Langridge quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we ought to name Parsons as
substitute pitcher on the &rsquo;varsity. He&rsquo;s been doing
excellent work, fully equal to yours, Langridge.
Of course he&rsquo;s a little uncertain yet, but one big
game would take that out of him. I&rsquo;d like to see
him pitch at least part of the game against Boxer
next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;re dissatisfied with me?&rdquo;
asked Langridge quickly, and his face flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. But I think it rather risky
not to provide better than we have for a substitute
pitcher. Evert is available, of course, but as he is
a junior his studies are such that he can&rsquo;t devote
the necessary time to practice. Parsons ought to
be named.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you demand that in your official capacity
as coach, Mr. Lighton?&rdquo; asked Kindlings. &ldquo;Because
if you do, I&rsquo;ll agree to it at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I merely make that suggestion to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at the manager. Langridge
stood with a supercilious smile on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume I shall have something to say as
manager,&rdquo; he remarked.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; admitted the coach gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I say Parsons shan&rsquo;t act as substitute
pitcher. I&rsquo;m good for the season, and I&rsquo;m going
to play it out. I see his game. He wants to oust
me and he&rsquo;s taken this means of doing it. He got
you to plead for him, Mr. Lighton. I&rsquo;ll not stand
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re entirely mistaken, Langridge,&rdquo; said the
coach, with the least suspicion of annoyance in his
even voice. &ldquo;It is my own idea. Parsons does not
even know that I have spoken to you; in fact, I
believe that he would not allow me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge was sneering now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he would,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you, as manager, don&rsquo;t want Parsons as
substitute pitcher?&rdquo; asked the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; snapped Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course if you order it, Mr. Lighton,&rdquo; began
honest Kindlings with an uneasy look at the coach&mdash;&ldquo;of
course if you make a point of it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Mr. Lighton spoke quietly.
&ldquo;That was not my intention&mdash;just yet. Parsons
will remain on the scrub then, at least for the present.
Later I may&mdash;er&mdash;I may make a point of it,&rdquo;
and he turned and walked away.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3>A SOPHOMORE TRICK</h3>


<p>While knowing nothing of the efforts Coach
Lighton was making in his behalf, Tom continued
hard practice at his pitching. Every day he made
some improvement until his friends on the scrub
regarded him as a marvel. But, as if some mysterious
whisper had come to Langridge, the latter
also showed improvement. He spent more time
in practice and at one game, when it looked as if
the scrub would beat the &rsquo;varsity, chiefly due to
Tom&rsquo;s fine pitching, Langridge saved the day by
brilliant work in the box. The coach was pleased
at this and Tom could not help feeling that his
chances were farther away than ever.</p>

<p>There were many other phases of college life,
aside from baseball, that appealed to Tom. He
liked his studies and he gave them more attention
than perhaps any other lad of the sporting set.
He was not a &ldquo;greasy dig,&rdquo; by which was meant a
student who burned midnight oil over his books,
but he stood well in his classes, for learning came
naturally to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so, however, to his roommate. Poor Sid
had to &ldquo;bone&rdquo; away rather hard to get along, and,
as he was required to put in a certain amount of
time on the diamond, his lessons sometimes suffered.
He was warned one day by Professor
Tines, in the Latin class, that if he did not show
more improvement he would be conditioned and
not allowed to play on the team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that mustn&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; declared Captain
Woodhouse. &ldquo;Take a brace, Sid. Don&rsquo;t go
throwing us down now. It&rsquo;s too late to break in
another first baseman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid promised, and, for a time, stood better in
his class. In the meanwhile other sports went on
at Randall College. The crew was out every day
on the river and the &rsquo;varsity eight-oared shell, several
doubles and some singles held impromptu
races. A freshman eight was formed and Tom
was asked to join, but he wisely refused, for he
reasoned that he could not give enough time to it
to become a member of a racing crew without
sacrificing either baseball or his studies, and he
would do neither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never make the &rsquo;varsity nine,&rdquo; argued
Captain Bonsell, of the freshman crew.
&ldquo;Much better to train with us, for I&rsquo;ll promise you
a place in the boat when it comes to the championship
race. You&rsquo;ll never be the &rsquo;varsity pitcher.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>For Bonsell had looked with envy on Tom&rsquo;s big
muscles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to give up until the last
game,&rdquo; declared Tom stoutly. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll get
a chance at the tail end. Langridge can&rsquo;t last forever,
though far be it from me to wish him any
bad luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; spoke Bonsell with a laugh, &ldquo;the survival
of the fittest. I wish you luck, old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Tom practiced and practiced and practiced
until on the scrub his name became one to conjure
with. But Langridge remained in his place on the
&rsquo;varsity and Evert was the substitute pitcher. Between
Tom and Langridge there was more than
ever a coldness. It was not due to the sneaking
act of the rich lad in not absolving Tom from
blame in the wire episode, but might more properly
be ascribed to the incident connected with Miss
Tyler, though neither youth was willing to admit
this. In spite of himself, Tom found that he was
entertaining a certain indescribable feeling toward
the girl. Often, at night, he would recall her
laughing, tantalizing face as she walked away with
Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; Tom would exclaim to his pillow.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not fit for her! She ought to know it. I
practically told her, yet she went off with him,
after all. Confound it all, I can&rsquo;t understand girls,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tom might well have been comforted, for
no one else does either, though many believe that
they do.</p>

<p>But, though part of Tom&rsquo;s coldness toward
Langridge was based on the latter&rsquo;s meanness
about the wire and though probably the &rsquo;varsity
pitcher kept aloof from Tom for the same reason,
there was no disposition on Tom&rsquo;s part to complain
or &ldquo;squeal.&rdquo; As far as the faculty was concerned,
Tom was guilty of the prank that had had so
nearly a fatal ending. But he did not complain.
He had given his word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, old man, going along?&rdquo; asked Sid
one day as he came in from a biology lecture and
tossed his text-book under the bed, though he
knew he would have to crawl for it afterward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going along where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The team&rsquo;s going to Dodville for a game with
a big prep. school there. Not much as regards a
game, but it will be fun. It&rsquo;s a nice trolley trip,
and I hear all the subs are going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a sub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a scrub, and that&rsquo;s almost the
same. Come along and root for us, anyhow,
though I guess we&rsquo;ll wipe up the earth with the
preps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought we had a game with Boxer to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did, but they canceled it, as they have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fill in a postponed game with Fairview, so we&rsquo;ve
shifted our schedule. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, if there&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there is. Langridge has hired two
special trolleys. You know he&rsquo;s not going to play
the regular &rsquo;varsity team. Only freshmen are to
be allowed on it. It&rsquo;s more for practice than anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. It was on the tip of his
tongue to ask if Sid thought there might be a
chance to do some pitching, but he thought better
of it.</p>

<p>The Dodville Preparatory School had a good
nine and a reputation of putting up a hard game,
but Langridge was set on the idea of playing only
freshmen against them, and thus it was decided.
On the afternoon of the game the team, many
supporters and the scrubs and substitutes boarded
two trolleys for the trip to the grounds.</p>

<p>It was a jolly crowd, and the way was enlivened
by songs and jokes. Tom was in the first car with
Sid and some others of his particular chums.
Langridge was also there, but he kept rather away
from Tom.</p>

<p>Out on the platform with the motorman was an
individual with a slouch hat pulled down over his
eyes and his coat collar turned up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that, a tramp?&rdquo; asked Tom as he noticed
the man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; admitted Sid. &ldquo;Begging a ride
maybe on the strength of this being a special.
Well, let him go. If you call attention to him, some
of the fellows may make a row and create a rough
house. Don&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom did not, but he noticed that the tramp appeared
to be very friendly to the motorman and
talked frequently with him. The electric line to
Dodville ran through a stretch of country not
thickly populated, and at one point it switched over
another trolley road which ran to a distant, thriving
village. The boys were so engrossed in their
fun, laughing and joking that they paid little attention
to matters outside, and the time passed quickly.
Holly Cross was giving (by request) an imitation
of a well-known vaudeville performer when Sid,
who happened to look out of the window, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, where, for the love of tripe, are
we? This isn&rsquo;t the road to Dodville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; you?&rdquo; demanded Dutch
Housenlager. &ldquo;Could the trolley car go off by
itself on a road alone? Answer me that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it could do, it&rsquo;s what it has
done,&rdquo; retorted Sid. &ldquo;I know this road. It goes
to Fayetmore, which is next door to Squankum
Center. Fellows, we&rsquo;re five miles from Dodville!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; cried Langridge, unwilling to believe
it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact!&rdquo; asserted Sid. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re five miles out of
our way, on the wrong road, and the game starts
in less than an hour. They&rsquo;ll call it a forfeit on
us and never stop twitting us about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you must be wrong,&rdquo; declared Holly
Cross. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you s&rsquo;pose the motorman knows
the way? It isn&rsquo;t as if this was an auto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid pulled open the front door. The tramp,
who had been talking to the motorman, had gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; began the first baseman, &ldquo;is this the
road to Dodville? Aren&rsquo;t you on the wrong line?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I don&rsquo;t rightly know,&rdquo; replied the
motorman somewhat timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; repeated Sid incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I&mdash;I hope this is the right road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hope so!&rdquo; cried Langridge. &ldquo;Well, I
should say yes. Why don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I&rsquo;m new on this section of the
line. To-day is my first run. I took the turn back
there where the gentleman told me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one who was out here on the platform
with me. He said he was your manager.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manager!&rdquo; fairly yelled Langridge. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;m the manager of this team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it. That&rsquo;s what the gentleman said.
He said he knew the road to Dodville, and when I
got to the switch he told me to come this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo; demanded Langridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
who was beginning to &ldquo;scent a rodent,&rdquo; as Holly
Cross said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave me his card,&rdquo; went on the motorman,
who had halted his car in the midst of a lonely
stretch of woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo; cried Sid.</p>

<p>The trolley man fumbled in his pocket for it.
Tom looked back, but could not see the other special
car. That had probably been some distance
behind the first one and had doubtless gone the
right road, the motorman not suspecting that his
predecessor was not ahead of him.</p>

<p>Sid took the bit of pasteboard which the man
held out to him. He looked at it and then uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;a soph trick! Listen
to this, fellows. This is Fenmore&rsquo;s card, and he&rsquo;s
written on it this message: &lsquo;This is only part of
what we sophs owe you freshies for the pavilion
game. There is more coming. Hope you have a
nice picnic in the woods.&rsquo; That fellow on the platform
was Fenmore,&rdquo; went on Sid. &ldquo;No wonder
he kept his hat down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here we are&mdash;part of the team&mdash;out here
in the wilderness, five miles from the game, which
starts in half an hour!&rdquo; cried Langridge in disgust.
&ldquo;Say, those sophs got back at us all right. We&rsquo;re
in a nice pickle!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>TOM MAKES A DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>There was consternation among the freshmen
and their supporters. With a divided team, part
of it being so far away from the grounds that it
was practically impossible to arrive on time, and
on a wrong road at that, the situation was enough
to discourage any nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you let that fellow tell you where
to go?&rdquo; demanded Sid of the motorman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he said he was your manager, and I believed
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manager!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross. &ldquo;Yes, we need
a manager. We need a nurse and a governess,
that&rsquo;s what we need. To think that twenty of the
brightest freshmen at Randall have been duped
by one soph! Wow! I must have blood!&rdquo; and
he began to dance and howl like a stage Indian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Langridge disgustedly after a few
minutes&rsquo; thought, which period was occupied on
the part of the others by the use of language more
strong and rugged than polite, &ldquo;the only thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
do is to go back. Make the best time you can and
see what we can do. Shift the car, motorman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I got orders not to start back until
half-past four. You see, this is a single-track road,
and I might run into a car coming in the opposite
direction. We&rsquo;ve got to stay here until four-thirty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was worse than ever, and a howl went up.
But suddenly Sid, who had been narrowly looking
at the motorman, took a step toward him. He
reached up, grabbed his beard and pulled it off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hayden!&rdquo; he exclaimed as there was revealed
to view the features of one of the liveliest of the
sophomore class. &ldquo;By all the gods that on Olympus
dwell, it&rsquo;s Hayden!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your service, gentlemen,&rdquo; exclaimed Hayden
with a mocking bow. &ldquo;This is a little pleasure
trip that Fenmore and I arranged for you. I hope
you enjoy it,&rdquo; and with another mocking bow he
slipped off the controller handle and leaped over
the dashboard of the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hired the regular motorman to let us take
his place,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t play
ball to-day,&rdquo; and he disappeared in the woods with
a tantalizing laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s catch him!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Let&rsquo;s scalp him and tie him to a tree,&rdquo;
proposed Dutch Housenlager.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked Sid. &ldquo;He knows this
part of the country like a book, for he&rsquo;s been hunting
in it. Better let him go. He&rsquo;ll only laugh the
more at us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we to do?&rdquo; demanded Langridge.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to lose the game.&rdquo; He was very
vexed, for he knew it would reflect on him as manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing I see to do is to walk back until
we meet another car and then send on word of this
abandoned one,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long walk,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Tom Parsons suddenly. &ldquo;An
auto is coming along the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe some of us can get a ride,&rdquo; proposed
Phil Clinton. &ldquo;We can go to town and hire a rig
for the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along the road rumbled some big vehicle.
There came in sight a big auto truck, ponderous
and heavy. It was one of several used by a milk
concern to transport cans to the railroad depot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll
take us to Dodville if we pay him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was hailed and the situation explained
to him. He looked dubious and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you take us?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;You
say you have no load on your truck, and it isn&rsquo;t
much out of your way. We&rsquo;ll pay you well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you would,&rdquo; admitted the man, &ldquo;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve heard of you students. If some of you ran
off with a trolley car, there&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; but what
you&rsquo;d take this truck away from me at some lonely
spot and go cruisin&rsquo; off like Captain Kidd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; promised the lads eagerly. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t cut up a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had some difficulty in convincing <a href="#image02">the man</a>
of this, but did so finally, and he <a href="#image02">allowed them to
pile in</a>. They had to stand up and the road was
rough. They were jolted about, for the truck was
not built for easy riding, but they did not mind
that, for they felt that there was a chance to play
the game, and they urged the man to put on all
speed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="THE MAN ALLOWED THEM TO PILE IN" title="THE MAN ALLOWED THEM TO PILE IN" /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_150">THE MAN ALLOWED THEM TO PILE IN</a></span>
</div>

<p>They reached Dodville just as the game was
about to be awarded to the preparatory school on a
forfeit. The members of the Randall nine who
had arrived in the second trolley car, which safely
made the trip, could not explain the absence of
their companions.</p>

<p>The game was started, but it was not remarkable
for any brilliant work on the part of the college
freshmen. In fact the other students played all
around them. Possibly this was due to the episode
that had occurred, for Langridge was nervous and
threw wild, giving a number of men their bases on
balls. Kerr asked him to let Tom pitch, but Langridge
refused arrogantly and with bitter words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
against the scrub twirler. Nor would he consent
that Evert should fill the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pitch!&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strike &rsquo;em
out next inning. You watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom happened to be in the dressing-room when
it was the turn of Randall to bat, and Langridge
came in. The &rsquo;varsity pitcher did not see his rival,
but going to where his valise was containing his
clothing, he took something from it. Tom saw
Langridge put a bottle to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s taking medicine,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>A moment later the pitcher hurried from the
room as his name was called to bat. Tom walked
to a window that gave a view of the grounds. As
he passed Langridge&rsquo;s valise he smelled a pungent,
alcoholic odor. He started and for a moment
could not tell what it was. Then it came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liquor! He&rsquo;s been drinking liquor!&rdquo; he almost
exclaimed aloud. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s broken the training
rules. I wonder&mdash;I wonder if this is what Sid
hinted at&mdash;if this is what Mr. Lighton meant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the diamond there came a sharp crack. It
was a bat meeting a swiftly pitched ball with that
inspiring sound that indicates a fair hit. Tom
saw Langridge speeding for first base, while Randall
lads were yelling at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a three-bagger!&rdquo; cried Tom delightedly,
and so it proved, Langridge bringing in a run a
moment later on a sacrifice hit by Holly Cross.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3>AN EXPOSTULATION</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; cried Langridge, dancing
about in a strange enthusiasm as he crossed the
home plate. &ldquo;Knock a home run, Kerr, and we&rsquo;ll
roll up a score. Then I&rsquo;ll strike out the next six
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were but two more innings to play, and
the run Langridge brought in had reduced the lead
against the Randall freshmen from 6 to 5. But
five runs are a big handicap, especially when you
can&rsquo;t depend on your pitcher. Kerr struck out and
so did Sid, who was up next. Langridge was disappointed,
though not discouraged, and he made
wild promises about what he was going to do. But
he did not fulfil them and got careless in his
pitching.</p>

<p>The game degenerated almost into a farce in the
last inning, when Dodville piled up four runs, making
the total score 17 to 5, it being the worst drubbing
the Randalls had received in many years.
The only consolation was that it was not the &rsquo;varsity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
team, but, as Kerr said, that was no excuse.
There were almost jeers mingled with the cheers
of the preparatory school lads, and it was a sore
and sorrowful lot of freshmen who made their way
to the special trolley cars, the stalled one having
been brought up in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s eating cloves?&rdquo; asked Sid Henderson
as he piled into the electric and threw his big mitt
on the seat beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some?&rdquo; asked Langridge, holding out a
quantity. &ldquo;I had toothache and I took a few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, don&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied Sid with a
quick look at the pitcher, whose eyes were unnaturally
bright. &ldquo;But if you have any ginger
about you, it might come in handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ginger&mdash;how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For this team. We need it. To be beaten by
a bunch of schoolboys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t have our regular team,&rdquo; explained
Langridge. &ldquo;Besides, I didn&rsquo;t have any
support. I pitched well, but you fellows didn&rsquo;t
back me up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an arrogant look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you pitched well, you did,&rdquo; exclaimed
Kerr with an unconcealed sneer in his voice. &ldquo;You
did hot work, you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about my three-bagger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t make up for your rotten pitching!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others looked at Kerr in surprise. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
something new for him to find fault openly with
Langridge. The latter felt it, too, and hardly
knew what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, make some excuse,&rdquo; went on the catcher
bitterly. &ldquo;We got dumped, and that&rsquo;s all there is
to it. I&rsquo;m not saying I did such brilliant work&mdash;none
of us did&mdash;but you did rotten, Langridge, and
you know it. It isn&rsquo;t as if you couldn&rsquo;t do better,
for we all know you can. You&rsquo;ve gone stale&mdash;or&mdash;or
something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom had an idea what it was that had made the
pitcher go &ldquo;stale.&rdquo; His brilliant hit and run had
been followed by a reaction, the result of the stimulant
he took. It is always thus.</p>

<p>Langridge stared at Kerr, his most particular
chum, and then, as if not understanding it, went off
by himself in a corner of the car. It was not a
jolly party that rode back to Randall College. Nor
were matters much better when they arrived. The
freshmen had to endure the taunts of the sophomores
concerning the trolley episode, as well as
their own unexpressed disappointment at the result
of the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sid,&rdquo; said Tom in their room that night, when
his roommate was stretched out on the old creaking
sofa&mdash;&ldquo;Sid, if you knew some member of&mdash;er&mdash;well,
the crew who didn&rsquo;t train properly&mdash;that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to say, did sneaking things on the sly&mdash;didn&rsquo;t keep
in form for a race, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? Is some member of the crew trying
to throw the college?&rdquo; cried Sid, suddenly sitting
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. Of course not. I&rsquo;m just supposing a
case. You know we have to suppose cases in our
psychology class. I&rsquo;m just taking one for the sake
of argument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Sid sleepily. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only a supposititious
case, all right. I thought you meant you
knew of some chap who was doing a dirty trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose I did know of one&mdash;or you did&mdash;what
would you do? Would you tell the
coach or the captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good would it do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point. Would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must have a reason for telling.
Don&rsquo;t you learn that in psychology?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Well, my reason might be that I
wanted to see the crew do good work and not lose
on account of some fellow who couldn&rsquo;t last out a
race because he broke training rules on the sly. Or
it might be that I wanted to see the fellow himself
take a brace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both good reasons, son. Both good. As the
Romans say, <i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i>. You
would do it for his own physical good. Very nice.
For his mental improvement also.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I, you conscientious old wind-ammer!
I know it. The trouble is you&rsquo;re too serious. Why
don&rsquo;t you let things slide sometimes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I s&rsquo;pose not. Well, then, fire away, old
chap. Wait until I get more comfortable, though,&rdquo;
and Sid turned and wiggled on the decrepit sofa
until it threatened to collapse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t answered my question yet,&rdquo; persisted
Tom when his chum had been silent for two
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What question? Oh, blazes, Tom, I thought
you&rsquo;d gone to sleep. But say, why don&rsquo;t you come
right out and say what you mean? Do you know
any member of the crew who&rsquo;s doing that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I told you this was a supposititious
case. But, if there was one, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you a supposititious answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid closed his eyes. The fussy little alarm clock
seemed to be counting time for him while he made
up his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell the fellow yourself?&rdquo; asked
Sid so suddenly that Tom jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Sid arose. He came and stood close to his
chum. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There be certain things, son,&rdquo; he said with an
assumed serious air which was more than half real,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
&ldquo;certain things that, in college, one might better
ignore. If, perchance, however, one is so constituted
morally that one can&rsquo;t; if the laws of the
Medes and the Persians are so immutable that one
can&rsquo;t rest&mdash;why, my young philosopher, take the
easiest course so long as you are true to your own
motto, <i>Dulce et decorum est pro alma mater mori</i>.
There, I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ve got the Latin
right, but it says what I mean&mdash;tell the other fellow
first&mdash;Tom,&rdquo; and with that he went over,
picked up his trigonometry and fell to studying.</p>

<p>It was not an easy fight that Tom had with himself
that night. He went all over the ground: the
arrogance of Langridge, the scene in the dressing-room,
the pungent odor of liquor and then his
knowledge of it. Was it fair to the team to let
the members be in ignorance of the fact that their
pitcher took stimulants secretly&mdash;that he had done
it before? For Tom was sure it was not the first
time. Would it not mean, in the end, that Randall
would lose some deciding game and the championship?
Tom thought so and determined that it was
his duty to do something. The question was, what?
In a measure Sid had solved this for him, and before
he fell asleep that night Tom determined to
expostulate with Langridge the first chance he got.</p>

<p>It came sooner than he expected. There was a
game with Boxer Hall on the grounds of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
university and it was expected to be a hard one,
which expectation was not unfulfilled.</p>

<p>For the first few innings Randall seemed to have
the contest well in hand. Then, during a few minutes
when his side was at bat, Langridge disappeared
into the dressing-room. With a heart that
beat harder than usual Tom quietly followed. He
was just in time to see Langridge putting away a
bottle that gave out the characteristic odor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; cried Tom quickly, but in a
low voice. He was hardly conscious of what he
was saying.</p>

<p>Langridge wheeled around and faced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do what?&rdquo; he asked sharply, his face
flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that liquor to brace you up. You&rsquo;ll only
pitch the worse for it, and it&rsquo;s not fair to the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge took a step toward Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right have you got to speak so to me?&rdquo;
he demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dirty sneak, that&rsquo;s what
you are, following in here to spy on me! I guess
I know what I&rsquo;m doing. Can&rsquo;t I take a little
toothache medicine without being insulted by you?
Liquor! Supposing it is? The doctor ordered it
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the middle of a game,&rdquo; said Tom
quietly. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s against training rules, and
you know it. It&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see your game,&rdquo; sneered Langridge. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
know what you&rsquo;re after. You want to tell some
story about me, thinking that I&rsquo;ll be dropped and
you can have my place. But you can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll do you
yet. I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em how I can pitch!&rdquo; He was
boasting now, for he was not himself. &ldquo;Get out
of my way, you dirty sneak!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to bat out a home run,&rdquo; and he put some cloves in
his mouth.</p>

<p>He almost knocked Tom over as he rushed past
him and went out in time to take his place at the
home plate. He did knock a home run to the delirious
delight of the team, but it was short-lived
joy, for, just as in the other games, Langridge
went to pieces in the box, and Boxer Hall won the
game by a score of 8 to 5. But the home run of
Langridge so shone out that even Kerr did not
have the heart to decry his friend&rsquo;s ragged pitching.
Coach Lighton, however, shook his head, as
the championship chances for Randall College
seemed fading away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Tom as he accompanied the
defeated team back that afternoon, &ldquo;I did my duty,
anyhow. I expostulated with him and was insulted
for my pains. I did all I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that night there came to him something like
a voice asking, &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; Tom tossed restlessly
on his bed. &ldquo;What shall I do next?&rdquo; he thought.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>SOME &ldquo;OLD GRADS&rdquo;</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old man?&rdquo; inquired Sid
the next morning as he rolled over in bed and
looked at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d been drawn through a knot
hole, and a small one at that. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; and Tom tried to laugh it off. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t sleep very well, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For that matter, neither did I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out! I heard you snoring away like a
boiler blowing off steam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must have been tired. I never snore
unless I am. Wow! ouch! Decameron&rsquo;s Prothonotary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid made a face that indicated intense anguish
and put his hand to his side as he turned over in
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strained my side when I slid for second base
that time. I didn&rsquo;t notice it yesterday, but it hurts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
like sin now. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to cut lectures to-day
and stay in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What excuse will you give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll say&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t, either,&rdquo; declared Sid
with a sudden change of decision. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it
was playing baseball that laid me up or Moses will
ask me to cut out the ball. I&rsquo;ve got to suffer. I
know what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll limp in chapel and on my
way to lectures. I&rsquo;m not prepared in trig, anyhow,
and maybe they&rsquo;ll let me off easy. I&rsquo;m sure to
slump in Latin, but maybe Pitchfork will have
mercy on a gladiator who was willing to die for
Csar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom felt like laughing, but he restrained himself
as he saw that Sid was really suffering. The
first baseman crawled out of bed with many a
groan and made wry faces. He limped across the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked Tom. &ldquo;Do I do it
naturally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. It would deceive anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to deceive &rsquo;em. It&rsquo;s gospel truth.
I&rsquo;m as lame as a sore horse. But I&rsquo;ll go down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me rub it,&rdquo; suggested Tom, and he forgot
part of his troubles in giving vigorous massage to
Sid&rsquo;s strained side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels better. Thanks, old man,&rdquo; declared
the hurt one as he began to dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re limping worse than ever.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. No use losing any of the advantages of
my limp. It may save me from a discredit in
Latin. Oh, if you want to know how to limp come
to your Uncle Dudley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom laughed and prepared for chapel. He
himself was in no very jolly mood, however, for
he could not help thinking of the problem connected
with the discovery about Langridge. That
it was a problem, and no small one, Tom was
ready to admit. He felt himself in a peculiar position.
He had spoken to the &rsquo;varsity pitcher and
had been insulted. To let him go on in his course,
breaking training and endangering the success of
the nine, Tom felt would not be right. Yet if he
spoke to the coach or captain about it there would
be but one construction put upon his action.</p>

<p>Tom could fancy Mr. Lighton thanking him for
the information about Langridge and could even
imagine the coach acting on it and warning the
pitcher. Tom could see the look on the face of
Kindlings when he was told. It would be a revelation.
Yet for all the service that he rendered to
the team there would be but one construction put
upon Tom&rsquo;s act by his classmates&mdash;he would be
accused of informing in order to oust Langridge
so that he might have the pitcher&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; declared Tom to himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to find some other way. I&rsquo;ll make one
more try with Langridge.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid&rsquo;s limp did not save him in Latin, for he
&ldquo;slumped&rdquo; most ungracefully, and with a black
look Professor Tines marked a failure against him,
accompanying it with words of warning. As for
Tom, his worry over the secret caused him to pay
too scant attention in his geography class, and he
was caught napping, whereat the instructor looked
surprised, for Tom was one of the best students.</p>

<p>The next day the scrub team went on a little trip
to Morriston to play a small semi-professional nine,
and Tom had a chance to show what he could do
in the box. He gave a fine exhibition of pitching,
so much so that the other nine was held down to a
goose-egg score, and there were very few hits secured
off Tom. The scrubs were wild about it and
held a celebration, for it was the best victory they
had scored yet.</p>

<p>During the next few days Tom saw little of
Langridge. In fact the &rsquo;varsity pitcher seemed to
be keeping out of the way of the lad who had
remonstrated with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him at the Boxer game Saturday,&rdquo;
thought Tom. &ldquo;If I get a chance, I&rsquo;ll make one
more attempt, though I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t do any
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next Boxer contest was a sort of annual
mid-season affair. It was a game which members
of the alumn of both colleges made it a point to
attend in even greater numbers than at the contests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
deciding the championship. In fact of late
years there had been no chance for such exhibitions,
for Randall did not have a &ldquo;look in&rdquo; at the pennant,
as Holly Cross used to say.</p>

<p>The game was to take place on the Randall
grounds, and before the hour when it was to be
played the stands and bleachers began filling up.
It was a beautiful afternoon about the middle of
May and a better one for a game could not have
been had, even if made to order.</p>

<p>Oh, how Tom wanted to play! But he could
only look on. The regular team came out for
practice, with the substitutes waiting for a chance
to go in. Then out trotted the Boxer Hall lads,
to be received with a cheer. There were pretty
girls galore, each one waving the flag of her particular
college. Tom moved about in the grandstand,
trying to pretend to himself that he was not
looking for any one, but all the same his heart gave
a great thump when he heard some one call:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom! Mr. Parsons!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you do, Miss Tyler?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t miss this for anything. I
just love to see the old graduates. They are so interesting,
just as if they were boys again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made room for Tom beside her, and he
gladly availed himself of the chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are quite a few of the old boys on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hand to-day,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Look at those two,&rdquo;
and he pointed to two well-dressed men, each attired
in a tall silk hat and a frock coat. They each
had a gold-headed cane and they were very staid in
looks, yet at the sight of each other they rose in
their seats, clasped hands across the heads of intervening
persons and one, the elder, cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well! If it isn&rsquo;t old Skeeziks! How are
you? I haven&rsquo;t seen you since I graduated in &rsquo;73!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor me you, you old fish-pedler! How are
things? Do you remember the day we kidnaped
Mrs. Maguire and took all her chickens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not so loud!&rdquo; cautioned the other, his
face breaking into smiles. &ldquo;The faculty never
found out who did that, and there&rsquo;s no use telling
now. But I am glad to see you. Do you think our
boys will win?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so, though I see by the papers they
haven&rsquo;t been playing as good ball as when we went
to school. They need a little ginger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I wish I was young again. We
certainly had some great games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On all sides similar scenes were being enacted
and like reminiscences were being exchanged. It
was a great day for the &ldquo;old grads,&rdquo; and they took
advantage of it. Many there were also from
Boxer, though they occupied a different part of the
grandstand. However, they exchanged visits with
their former rivals during the practice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Ford Fenton was in his element. His uncle,
who had been a coach at Randall, was on hand,
and Ford was showing him off as if he was a prize
animal at a county fair.</p>

<p>Ford wanted to take his uncle around and introduce
him to his classmates, but Mr. Fenton declined,
as he wanted to meet some of his old
friends. But this did not deter Ford from going
about telling the news, and about all he could be
heard to say was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle, the former coach, is here. He came
to see the game. My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the long-suffering ones would turn away,
or if they were lads who had no particular regard
for Ford&rsquo;s feelings, they would guy him unmercifully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, Ford!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross after about half
an hour of this sort of thing, &ldquo;have you heard the
latest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, &lsquo;my uncle&rsquo; says that if you don&rsquo;t stop
talking about him, he&rsquo;s going to leave and take
you with him. He says he&rsquo;s being &lsquo;uncled&rsquo; to
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Dutch Housenlager.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Ford, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; and he pretended
to collide accidentally with the lad, knocking
him against Holly, who promptly pushed him
back.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>But now practice was over. The rival captains
were in conference, the umpire was taking the new
ball from the tinfoil wrapping and the spectators
were settling back for the contest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boxer has improved since the other game,&rdquo;
said Tom, who had been critically watching the
teams at practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I heard,&rdquo; replied Miss Tyler.
&ldquo;Oh, I do hope our boys will win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom as he watched Langridge,
who was first to go to the bat, in this game
the visitors winning the privilege of being last up.
Tom tried to notice the &rsquo;varsity pitcher, to see if
he was in good form, but he could not judge then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire, and Dave Ogden,
the Boxer pitcher, drew back his arm to deliver
a swift curve.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>TOM IN COLD WATER</h3>


<p>Langridge at the first effort sent out a hot
liner, which flew just over the pitcher&rsquo;s head. The
second baseman made a jump for it and the ball
began to roll along in front of the center fielder.
Amid a wild burst of yells Langridge raced for
first and got there safely, not daring to go on to
second, as Ogden had run down to help cover it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff! that&rsquo;s the stuff! That&rsquo;s the
way to line &rsquo;em out!&rdquo; chanted an excited voice, and
Tom looked around to see the two silk-hatted &ldquo;old
grads&rdquo; embracing each other and doing an impromptu
dance in their seats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they jolly!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very, but they&rsquo;re crowing too soon. The game
has only just begun. Boxer Hall will play strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Tom&rsquo;s prediction came true, for in spite
of the auspicious opening by Langridge, not a man
crossed home plate for the Randalls that inning,
the pitcher dying on third. Then it came the turn
of the home team to show what they could do in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
holding down the visitors. It looked as if they
were going to do it, too, for Langridge struck out
the first two men. But he gave the next one a pass
to first and was batted for a two-bagger by the
following player, the inning ending with one run
for Boxer. The Randall College boys and their
girl supporters began to look anxious and so did
some of the &ldquo;old grads.&rdquo; On the other side there
was laughter, cheers and jollity, while some of the
aged former students of Boxer began to chant oldtime
college songs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do hope our fellows win,&rdquo; exclaimed
Miss Tyler, and there was an anxious look on her
pretty face, while she tapped her flag of colors impatiently
against her little foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a bet on the game?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;A
box of candy or some gloves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I want to see Randall win. Besides,
Fred&mdash;I mean Mr. Langridge&mdash;he told me he
was going to work hard for success, and I never
like to see any one disappointed&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom rather shortly. He really did
not care to hear his rival&rsquo;s praises sung by this fair
damsel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking
of what you started to tell me about him the
other day. Is it really true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Tom slowly, &ldquo;if you will excuse
the privilege of a friend who has known you for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
some time, I would say that I don&rsquo;t believe your
people would like you to go with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, mamma knows his uncle, who is his
guardian, and she says he is very nice&mdash;I mean the
uncle,&rdquo; and she laughed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it. I only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom did not say what he was going to, for
just then Pinky Davenport, captain of the Boxers,
knocked what Holly Cross described later as a
&ldquo;lalapoolassa&rdquo; fly, which went clear over the center
fielder&rsquo;s head and netted a home run for the
captain of the visitors.</p>

<p>What yelling and shouting there was then! It
seemed to put new life into the opponents of Randall,
if such was needed, for they began piling up
the score until they were six runs in the lead.</p>

<p>Then Randall &ldquo;took a brace,&rdquo; encouraged by
the yells of the &ldquo;old grads&rdquo; and others, and by the
eighth inning had cut it down even. In the close
of the eighth they held their opponents down to
one run, making it necessary to gather in two to
win the game, but with that it meant holding the
visitors hitless in the last half of the final inning.</p>

<p>The first part of the program was carried out
all right. By some phenomenal playing Randall
managed to get the lead by one run. They would
have had another but for a miscalculation on the
part of Ed Kerr, who was caught napping between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
third and home, where he was run down and put
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, we have them on the hip!&rdquo; exclaimed
Captain Woodhouse as he called his players
together for a little talk before the final struggle
was made. &ldquo;If we can hold them down this
inning we have them. Langridge, it&rsquo;s up to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it. But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It sounded well, and there was a determined
look in the pitcher&rsquo;s face, but his eyes were unnaturally
bright. His pitching had been ragged
during the last three innings and the sudden decline
of the abilities of the Boxer players had done as
much as anything to give Randall her chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope Fred strikes three out, one right
after the other!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Tyler as she
shifted nervously in her seat. &ldquo;He must be under
a dreadful strain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably he is,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But if he takes a
brace now he&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been taking too many bracers&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter with him,&rdquo; said a voice back of
Tom, and he knew it was one of the former graduates
speaking. Tom looked at the girl beside him.
Either she had not heard or she took no notice of
the remark.</p>

<p>It was a tense moment when Langridge sent in
the first ball. It was called a strike and the batsman
looked surprised. The next was a ball, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
two more strikes were called without the player
getting a chance to swing at the horsehide. Langridge
smiled at the cheers which greeted him.
Then he did what few other pitchers could have
done under the circumstances. He struck out the
next two men, though one did manage to hit a high
foul, which Kerr missed. Langridge had saved
the game by holding the other team hitless.</p>

<p>Such a cheer as went up then when it was seen
that Randall had won! The stamping of feet on
the stands sounded like thunder. Back of Tom
and Miss Tyler two old men began yelling like Indians,
hugging each other and whirling about.
They were the two &ldquo;old grads&rdquo; of &rsquo;73. They were
waving their hats in the air and yelling &ldquo;Randall!
Randall! Randall!&rdquo; until their faces were the color
of raw beef.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; cried the taller of the two. &ldquo;This
does my heart good! I&rsquo;m forty years young again.
Wow! Whoop-la!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he drew back his hand and his silk hat
went sailing over the edge of the grandstand to the
grass of the outfield. It was caught by some Randall
players and quickly kicked out of shape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that was a new hat!&rdquo; exclaimed the man&rsquo;s
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but there&rsquo;s more where that came
from. I can buy a new hat every day, but I can&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
see my old college win such a game as this. Wow!
Whoop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; and a second hat
went the way of the first, while the old men capered
about like boys. They were given a round of
cheers on their own account by the team when the
players understood what had happened. Ford
Fenton was running about, all excited, trying to
find his relative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen my uncle?&rdquo; he asked several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross. &ldquo;And if I do, I&rsquo;ll
shoot him on sight! Get out or I&rsquo;ll eat you up,&rdquo;
and with a roar of simulated wrath he rushed at
poor Fenton, who beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>Tom was jubilant at the success of his college,
nor did he withhold unstinted praise for Langridge.
He had been surprised at the sudden improvement
shown. Tom and Miss Tyler walked
across the grounds toward the campus, the girl
looking back several times. Suddenly Langridge
appeared from amid a group of players.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute,&rdquo; he called to Miss
Tyler, &ldquo;as soon as I change my duds. Wait
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an air of proprietorship in the words
and the girl must have felt them, for she turned
away without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better say good-afternoon,&rdquo; spoke
Tom, a trifle piqued.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want to,&rdquo; she replied with a
quick look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t want to, but I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to think,&rdquo; she added with a little
laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tiresome. Come and show me the
river. Not that I haven&rsquo;t seen it before, but it&rsquo;s
so beautiful to-day, I want some one to enjoy it
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to go for a little row?&rdquo;
asked Tom. &ldquo;I can get a boat and we&rsquo;ll go to
Crest Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be lovely. The water is like glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were soon afloat. Tom was a good oarsman
and sent the light craft ahead with powerful
strokes. They spent some little time on the island,
where other pleasure seekers were, and when the
shadows began to lengthen started back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it ever so much,&rdquo; said Miss Tyler
gratefully as the craft neared the float adjoining
the college boathouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Tom heartily. &ldquo;Perhaps
you will go again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I probably shall&mdash;if any one asks me,&rdquo; she replied
archly, and then he helped her out, whispering
as he did so, for there were quite a number on
the float, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to ask you, Madge.&rdquo; Tom
may have imagined it, but he thought there was
just a little return of the pressure when he pressed
the hand he held.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought you were going to wait for
me,&rdquo; exclaimed a voice, and Langridge pushed his
way through the throng and came close to where
Miss Tyler was standing, waiting for Tom to tie
the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Langridge did not know
what to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me now,&rdquo; said
the girl calmly, though she smiled at Langridge in
no unfriendly fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and take a walk,&rdquo; he almost ordered.
&ldquo;I want to say something to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she could answer Tom was at her side.
He looked keenly at Langridge and was about to
make some reply when the &rsquo;varsity pitcher reached
out as though to link his arm in that of the girl.
Miss Tyler drew back and Langridge edged himself
forward. He may have been merely eager or
it may have been the result of intention. At any
rate, he jostled Tom to one side and the next minute
the pitcher of the scrub, vainly endeavoring to
retain his balance, toppled into the cold water of
the river.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>A GAME OF ANOTHER SORT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; screamed Miss Tyler. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
drowned! Save him, some one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was much commotion on the float. The
crowd surged to the edge and it tilted dangerously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back! get back!&rdquo; cried Dan Woodhouse.
&ldquo;Get a boathook, some one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; cried the Jersey twins, and together
they darted for the place where the rowing craft
were stored.</p>

<p>Langridge seemed stupefied at the result of his
act. He stood there, peering down into the water
beneath which Tom had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back, I tell you! Get back!&rdquo; yelled Woodhouse.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get him out if you tilt the float
so. We&rsquo;ll all be in the water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Understanding this, the crowd of lads and girls
moved back. Captain Woodhouse was peering
over the edge of the dock, looking for a sight of
Tom, and meanwhile was taking off his coat and
vest, preparatory to a plunge in.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is! I see his head!&rdquo; suddenly cried
Miss Tyler, and she pointed to a dark object barely
visible in the shadows that were settling down over
the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo; cried Langridge thickly, but he
could not seem to unbutton his coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried a voice, and a tall, lithe figure,
clad only in a rowing jersey and trunks, pattered
in bare feet down the length of the float.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Fenmore!&rdquo; exclaimed several, and the tall
sophomore, who had been out in a single shell and
who, arriving at the float, had understood what
had happened, plunged in. He swam quickly to
Tom, who seemed bewildered and unable to help
himself. But, if he was dazed, which they later
found to be the case, he had sense enough to let
Fenmore rescue him in the proper fashion and
was soon being lifted out on the float. His face
was pale and blood from a cut on his forehead
trickled down one cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much hurt?&rdquo; asked Dan Woodhouse as he put
his arms about Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;not much,&rdquo; gasped the rescued one.
&ldquo;I hit my head on the edge and that dazed me. I
couldn&rsquo;t strike out, and I swallowed some&mdash;some
water,&rdquo; he gulped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; but Tom began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
shiver, for the evening had turned cool and the
water was not yet right for bathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, take my cloak for him!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Tyler, impulsively holding out a thin wrap which
was more for appearance than utility. &ldquo;It will
keep him warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will ruin it,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as wet as
a rat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter!&rdquo; cried the girl imperiously, and she
tried to wrap it about Tom&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are some sweaters,&rdquo; said the more practical
Kindlings. &ldquo;Now run up to the infirmary,
Tom, get into a hot bath and throw some hot
lemonade into you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom prepared to start off and Miss Tyler had
taken back her cloak. She went closer to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. It was all on my account,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I hope you will be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Su&mdash;sure I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be all&mdash;all right,&rdquo; declared
Tom, though his teeth chattered in spite of himself,
for he had sustained a nervous shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll inquire for you to-morrow,&rdquo; she added with
a smile as she turned aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, old man, I&rsquo;m afraid I pushed you in, but
I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;&rsquo;pon my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Langridge
earnestly as he edged up to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;now,&rdquo; answered
Tom, and then his chums rushed him up
to the college, where a warm bath and drinks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
soon effectively administered. No bad results attended
the unexpected plunge, and that night Tom
was able to join in the celebration that followed the
winning of the ball game, when many bonfires
blazed and the students were allowed more license
than usual.</p>

<p>It was about a week later when, following a
rather hard series of games between the scrub and
&rsquo;varsity teams in which Tom had strained his arm,
Coach Lighton advised him to get a new kind of
liniment to rub on it. It could only be had in a
certain store in town, and, obtaining permission to
go there on condition that he return to college before
nine o&rsquo;clock, Tom started off alone one evening.
Sid had to make up some lessons he was
&ldquo;shaky&rdquo; on, and though he wanted to take the
walk, he did not feel that he dared spare the time.</p>

<p>On his way to the drug store Tom passed the
side entrance of a certain resort much patronized
by the &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; class of students. Several lads
were in there, as Tom could tell by the snatches of
college songs that floated out, and as he got opposite
the place the door swung open to give entrance
to others and Tom saw Langridge sitting at a
table with several flashily dressed lads. They were
playing cards and glasses of some sort of liquor
stood at their elbows, while most of them, including
Langridge, were smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s broken training with a vengeance!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Tom in a low voice as he hurried on.
&ldquo;Cigarettes are the limit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom tried not to think about what he had seen
as he went on to the drug store and had his prescription
filled. He had to wait some little time for
it and as he came out he noticed by a clock that he
would have to hurry if he wanted to get back to
college in time.</p>

<p>He started off briskly and just as he got in front
of the side door of the resort the portal opened
and several lads came out. Langridge was with
them, and all were somewhat worse for the lively
evening they had spent. The &rsquo;varsity pitcher, who
seemed strangely hilarious, caught sight of Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if there ain&rsquo;t my deadly rival!&rdquo; he cried
in what was intended to be a friendly manner, but
which was silly. &ldquo;Hello, Parsons! Come in and
have a cigarette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer in conciliatory tones.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get back to the college. My
time&rsquo;s nearly up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine&mdash;so&rsquo;s all of us. But what&rsquo;s the odds?
We&rsquo;ve got to have a good time once in a while,
eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; came the chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t smoke, I&rsquo;m in training,&rdquo; spoke Tom, intending
it to be a hint, if not to Langridge, at least
to his companions.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I, you old hunk of fried tripe! Have a
smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Tom started on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Langridge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.
I&rsquo;m going to shake you fellows,&rdquo; and he waved his
hand to his companions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be virtuous
and go to bed with the larks. I wonder if
larks do go to bed, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean chickens,&rdquo; declared one of the
others with a laugh. &ldquo;Come on then, fellows, if
Langridge goes back, we&rsquo;ll stay and have some
more fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was not unwilling to play the good Samaritan,
so linking his arm in that of Langridge, he
led him down the street. The &rsquo;varsity pitcher was
not as steady on his feet as he should have been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll tell Kindlings and Lighton
about me, eh, what?&rdquo; he asked brokenly as he
walked along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom quietly. &ldquo;But you ought to cut
it out, Langridge, if not for your own sake for the
sake of the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right, old man, I ought.
You&rsquo;re a good sort of chap, too preachy maybe, but
all right. I ought to cut it out, but I like fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to give up smoking and drinking,&rdquo;
went on Tom boldly. He had determined that this
was just the chance he wanted and decided that he
would take advantage of it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again! there you go again!&rdquo; cried
Langridge fretfully, with a sudden change of manner
peculiar to him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to lecturing. I
get enough of that from Moses and Pitchfork.
Give us a rest. I&rsquo;m all right. Have another cigarette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Tom declined the proffered one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot you don&rsquo;t smoke. That&rsquo;s right.
It&rsquo;s bad for the heart. I don&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em only once
in a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom tried to reason with him, but Langridge
was not himself and answered pertly or else insulted
Tom for his good offices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to give up gambling, too,&rdquo; Tom
said, starting on a new tack. They were nearing
the college now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again! there you go again!&rdquo; exclaimed
Langridge and he was almost crying, silly
in his excitement.</p>

<p>He sat down on a stone along the road and
lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s argue this thing out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
feel just like arguing, Parsons. Guess we&rsquo;ll call
you &lsquo;dominie,&rsquo; you&rsquo;re so fond of preaching. Let&rsquo;s
argue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom tried to urge him to come on. It was getting
late and only by running could they reach college
and report before the prescribed hour, nine
o&rsquo;clock. But Langridge was obstinate and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
not come. Tom did not want to leave him, for he
had heard that Langridge did not stand any too
well with the faculty, and a few more demerits
would mean that he would have to give up athletics.
So Tom determined that, if possible, he
would get the foolish lad within bounds in time.</p>

<p>But it was a useless undertaking, and Tom
heard nine strokes boom out on the chapel bell
when they were some distance from college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cooks our goose!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t so much matter for me, as it&rsquo;s the first
time, but Langridge will suffer if he&rsquo;s caught in
this plight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He redoubled his persuasive powers and by dint
of much talk at length induced Langridge to get
up and come on. But it was half-past nine now
and it was twenty minutes to ten, when, with his
arm linked in that of the lad he was trying to save
in spite of himself, Tom walked up the campus to
get to the dormitory.</p>

<p>The watchman opened the door at his knock.
Langridge had slipped behind Tom and stood in
the deep shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After hours,&rdquo; said the man simply. &ldquo;You will
report to the proctor to-morrow morning, Mr.
Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Tom simply. Langridge was
moving uneasily about in the shadows on the stone
steps.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one with you, Mr. Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The watchman started to go out, thinking to
catch several students. At that instant Langridge,
with a cunning evidently born of long experience,
circled around Tom on the opposite side to that on
which the watchman stood and darted down a
small areaway that led to the basement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! trying to hide!&rdquo; exclaimed the guardian
of the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out who you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the darkness he went down into the areaway.
A moment later Langridge had roughly upset him
there, and before the man could gain his feet, the
pitcher had sprinted up the steps and into the open
door of the dormitory and thence along the corridor
to his room. The watchman had not had a
glimpse of his face.</p>

<p>The man came panting up the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who was that with you, Mr. Parsons?&rdquo;
he demanded sternly as he rubbed his bruised shins.</p>

<p>Tom took a sudden resolve. There might be a
chance for Langridge to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell,&rdquo; he said firmly but respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You must report to
Mr. Zane in the morning. I&rsquo;ll inform him of this
outrage. He&rsquo;ll make you tell who was with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he will,&rdquo; thought Tom as he
went to his room.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3>ON THE GRILL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Sid as Tom came in.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going the pace, aren&rsquo;t you, old man?&rdquo; and
he looked anxiously at his chum, whose face was
flushed from the experience through which he had
just gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got in late,&rdquo; admitted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get caught?&rdquo; asked Sid, as if that was all that
mattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, but that&rsquo;s not the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;ve been
caught? Well, of all things. You, one of the
&lsquo;grinds,&rsquo; falling a victim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t altogether my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom considered for a moment. Would it be
violating the ethical honor of a college boy if he
told his chum? Would it be contrary to the spirit
of Randall? Tom thought not, merely to let Sid
know what had happened. For it would go no
further, and, as a matter of fact, several students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
had seen Tom and Langridge leave town together.
Besides, Tom wanted advice. So he told his chum
everything from the time of meeting with the
sporty students until the sensational retreat of
Langridge to his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what would you do?&rdquo; asked Tom.
&ldquo;Keep still and take what&rsquo;s coming or tell the
proctor and use that as an excuse for coming in
late? It really wasn&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid scratched his head. It was a new problem
for him. He saw the point Tom made, that by informing
on a fellow student, Tom would be held
blameless, as indeed he had a right to be. Why
should Tom suffer for another&rsquo;s fault? That came
plainly to Sid. Yet he only hesitated a moment before
answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t squeal,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; agreed Tom, as if
that was all there was to it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take
what&rsquo;s coming, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe proc. won&rsquo;t be hard on you. You&rsquo;ve
got a good record.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairly. Anyhow, I hope he doesn&rsquo;t cut me out
from baseball. Well, I&rsquo;m going to bed. I wonder
if they&rsquo;ll find out about Langridge? If the watchman
thought to make a tour of the rooms, he&rsquo;d discover
that he just got in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not do that. Too many of &rsquo;em. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
trust Langridge for knowing how to take care of
himself. He&rsquo;s getting reckless, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you won&rsquo;t say anything to any of the
fellows about him playing cards and smoking,&rdquo;
went on Tom, but he did not mention the drinking
episode, though probably Sid guessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; came the prompt answer, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s not fair to the rest of the team. However, I&rsquo;m
not going to make a holler. Hope you come out of
it all right. By-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; grunted Tom, for he was rubbing some
of the liniment on his arm and the pungent fumes
made him keep his eyes and mouth shut.</p>

<p>Sid tumbled into bed, leaving Tom to put out
the light, and there was no further talk. Tom undressed
slowly. He was in no mood for sleep, for
he was much upset over the incident of the night,
and he was not a little anxious about the next day
and his prospective visit to the proctor. For the
first time that he noticed it, the ticking of the alarm
clock annoyed him, the fussy, quick strokes making
him say over and over again the words of a silly
little rhyme as one sometimes, riding in a railroad
train, fits to the click of the wheels over the rail
joints some bit of doggerel that will not be ousted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be getting nervous,&rdquo; thought Tom.
&ldquo;Wonder if I&rsquo;m over-training?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This idea gave him such an alarm that it served
to change the current of his thoughts, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
he knew it he had fallen asleep over a half-formed
resolution to undertake a different sort of gymnasium
exercise for a few days.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s first visit the next morning after chapel
was, as the rules required in such cases, to Proctor
Zane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired that functionary in no pleasant
voice as Tom stood before him, for there had
been some skylarking in the college the previous
night and the proctor had been unable to catch the
offenders. &ldquo;What is it now, Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke as though Tom was an habitual offender
when, as a matter of fact, though the lad
had taken his part in pranks, it was only the second
time he had been &ldquo;on the grill,&rdquo; as the process was
termed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got in after hours last night, sir,&rdquo; reported
Tom quietly, though he resented the man&rsquo;s manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! So I was informed by the watchman.&rdquo;
He looked at Tom antagonistically. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
snapped, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you continue? There&rsquo;s more,
isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; replied Tom calmly. &ldquo;I
had permission to go to town, but I got in late,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it? What about the student who was
with you? Wasn&rsquo;t there some one with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t he engage in a fight with the watchman,
and, taking advantage of a mean trick, sneak
to his room? Didn&rsquo;t he, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume the watchman has correctly informed
you of what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s voice was coldly indifferent now, and the
proctor recognized that fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;And you know of it,
too. I expected you to tell me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when has it been a college rule,&rdquo; asked
Tom, &ldquo;to confess to the doings of another student?
I thought that all that was required of me was to
report my own infraction of the rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom knew that he was right and that the proctor
had no authority to ask him concerning the
doings of Langridge, and the proctor knew that he
himself was in the wrong, which knowledge, shared
as it was by a student, did not add to his good
temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you refuse to say who was with you?&rdquo; he
snapped, his eyes fixed on Tom&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly refuse to inform on a fellow student,
Mr. Zane,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think
you have any right to ask me to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he had stopped with his first half of the reply
all might have been well, for certainly the proctor
did not expect Tom or any other student to be a
tale-bearer, though he always asked them to speak
in order to make more easy his own task. But to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
be practically defied, and by a freshman, was too
much for the official, who had a certain dignity of
which he was proud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you are impertinent, Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t so intend, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! I don&rsquo;t have to be informed of my rights
by you. I know them. You will write me out two
hundred lines of Virgil by to-morrow afternoon
and you will stand suspended for two weeks, with
absolutely no privileges regarding athletics or
going away from college!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a hard sentence under any circumstances.
It was an unjust one in Tom&rsquo;s case, and he knew it.
Yet what could he do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; he replied, trying to overcome
a certain trembling feeling in his throat, and he
turned to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; went on the proctor in a slightly more conciliatory
voice, &ldquo;you think better of your resolution
and let me know the name of the student who
so outrageously assaulted the watchman, I may
find it possible to mitigate your punishment. Mind,
I am not asking you to inform me in an ordinary
case of breaking the rules, but for an extraordinary
infraction. The watchman has a badly injured
leg. So, if you wish to inform me later, I will be
glad to hear from you.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not change my mind,&rdquo; said Tom simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I mine,&rdquo; added the proctor, jerking out the
words quickly.</p>

<p>Tom turned on his heel and left the room.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h3>DARK DAYS</h3>


<p>Sid was waiting for Tom outside the proctor&rsquo;s
office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked eagerly as his chum appeared,
but it needed only a look at the downcast face to
tell that it was not &ldquo;well&rdquo; but &ldquo;ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rusticated!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On your own account, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mainly because I wouldn&rsquo;t tell, I guess. Being
out late just once isn&rsquo;t so monstrous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Still you couldn&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. It&rsquo;s tough, though. Suspended
twice in the first term! I wonder what dad and the
girls&rsquo;ll say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll have to, but I guess they&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is rocky,&rdquo; admitted Sid, &ldquo;but, do
you know, I envy you a bit. It&rsquo;s getting mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
hard in class now. I have to bone away like a
Trojan. Pitchfork has it in for me on Latin. I
wish I had a vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without baseball?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-o&mdash;no, of course not without being on the
team. But two weeks are soon over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not soon enough,&rdquo; and Tom darted away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back and study. I can&rsquo;t afford to fall behind in
my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, but aren&rsquo;t you the grinder, though!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sid, but there was something of envy in
his tone for all that. He went into recitation, while
Tom continued on to their common room. He was
walking along the path that led past Booker
Memorial Chapel and paused for a moment to admire
the effect of the early sun shining through a
stained glass window. The combination of colors
was perfect, and Tom, as he stood and looked at a
depiction of a biblical scene which represented the
Good Samaritan ministering to the stranger, felt
somehow that it was a rle that he himself had had
a part in.</p>

<p>Then came a revulsion of feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! You&rsquo;re getting sentimental in
your old age!&rdquo; he exclaimed half aloud. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got to have your share of hard knocks in this
world, and you&rsquo;ve got to take what comes. But
it&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he went on in his self-communing, &ldquo;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Langridge seems to be getting mixed up with me.
This is twice I&rsquo;ve had to suffer on his account. I&rsquo;d
like&mdash;yes, hang it all, what&rsquo;s the use of pretending
to yourself&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to take it out of him&mdash;in some
way. It&rsquo;s not fair&mdash;that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought of Langridge brought another sort
of musing to Tom. He saw a certain fair face,
with pouting lips and bright, dancing eyes, a face
framed in a fluffy mass of hair, and he fancied he
could hear a little laugh, a mocking little laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and worse,&rdquo; growled Tom to himself.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting dopy. Better go take a long
walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kicked impatiently at a stone in the path and
wheeled around just as a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Parsons, admiring the windows? The
color effects are never so beautiful as early morning
and the evening. The garish light of day seems to
make them common. But&mdash;er&mdash;are you going to
recitation? If so, I&rsquo;ll walk along with you,&rdquo; and
genial Dr. Churchill, with a friendly nod of his
head and a twinkle in his deep-set eyes, came closer
to the lad.</p>

<p>Tom wondered if the good doctor knew of the
punishment that had just been meted out. If he
did not he soon would have the report of the proctor
for confirmation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been suspended,&rdquo; blurted out Tom. &ldquo;I
was going to my room to study.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Suspended, Parsons! This is the second time,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; There was surprise and dismay in the
doctor&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Tom paused. How much
should he tell, how much leave unsaid?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked the head of the
college, and he placed his arm on Tom&rsquo;s shoulder
in a friendly fashion. Tom said afterward that it
was just as if he had been hypnotized. Before he
knew it he was telling the whole story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I never mentioned the name of Langridge,&rdquo;
he protested to Sid, to whom later he related all
the events. &ldquo;I never even hinted at it, but for all
that I believe Moses knew. He&rsquo;s a regular corkscrew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill was silent after the recital, a recital
rather brokenly made, but containing all the
essential facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suspended for two weeks!&rdquo; he murmured when
Tom had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With no athletics,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;Not even
to see the games that are to be played here, and
there are to be two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; mused the doctor. &ldquo;Well, you know
we must have discipline here, Parsons. Without
it we would soon have chaos. But&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;hum!
Well, come and see me this evening. I will
have a talk with Mr. Zane. He has to be strict,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
you know, very strict under certain circumstances,
but&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;come and see me to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose he wants?&rdquo; asked Sid when
Tom had told him of the meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I know, unless it&rsquo;s to give me a lecture
on my conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Moses isn&rsquo;t that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to restore to you all the rights and
privileges of a student,&rdquo; declared Phil Clinton,
who, together with some others of Tom&rsquo;s chums,
was in his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ford Fenton, but
instantly there was a protesting howl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me that water pitcher!&rdquo; demanded Sid of
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t fit to drink,&rdquo; was the remonstrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but Fenton needs a bath, don&rsquo;t you,
Ford? Your uncle! Say, the next time you say
that we&rsquo;ll make you repeat the first book of Csar
backward, eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Fenton in somewhat aggrieved
tones, &ldquo;he once told me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write it out,&rdquo; expostulated Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move he be given leave to print,&rdquo; came from
Sid, who had once heard a long debate in Congress.</p>

<p>There was laughter and more chaffing of luckless
Fenton, whose uncle, from his own making, was
like unto a millstone hung about his neck.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all the same, I&rsquo;d like to know what Moses
wants of you,&rdquo; said Phil, and the others agreed
with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know when I come back,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early; you can all stay here for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He returned in half an hour from his call on the
head of the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded his chums of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He received me in his
study. Say, were you ever there? It&rsquo;s a fine place.
Books, books, books all over. The floor was piled
full of them. There was a fire going on the grate
and he was sitting there, reading some book with
the queerest letters in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sanskrit,&rdquo; ventured Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so. Well, he brought up a chair for
me, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of Dionysius! give us some
facts,&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he said he&rsquo;d had a talk with the proctor
and he removed the worst part of my suspension.
I can go to the two games here with Boxer Hall
and Fairview, but I can&rsquo;t play. I couldn&rsquo;t, anyhow,
on account of my arm, so that&rsquo;s all right.
And I can attend the special lectures in biology,
which I hated to miss. I can&rsquo;t recite for two weeks,
but I don&rsquo;t mind that. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll vote for
Moses every time!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say yes,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s white,
he is. But Zane&mdash;ugh! He&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treason,&rdquo; counseled Sid quietly. &ldquo;The walls
may not have ears, but the keyhole has. Better
cut it, fellows, the time is almost up, and Zane&rsquo;s
scouts will be sneaking around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other lads departed, leaving Tom and Sid
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about your pitching?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to give my arm a rest, Mr.
Lighton says, so this comes in the nature of a special
providence. It isn&rsquo;t so bad as it looked at
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, in spite of his philosophy, there were dark
days for Tom. It was hard to be deprived of the
chance to play on the scrub and he missed the daily
recitations. His arm, too, began to trouble him,
and he was obliged to go to a doctor for treatment,
though the medical man said all it needed was a
little massage and rest. Tom, in his eagerness to
excel, had overworked the muscles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the &rsquo;varsity nine was kept busy at
practice or with league and other games. Word
came that both the Boxer and Fairview nines had
greatly improved, chiefly by shifting their players
about, and the Randall coach and captain wore
serious looks as they &ldquo;sized up&rdquo; the work of the
Randall team.</p>

<p>There came a contest with Fairview Institute on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the Randall diamond. It was a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; game and
Fairview won.</p>

<p>There was anguish of heart among the Randall
students and it was not assuaged when, the next
week, Boxer, playing on the Randall grounds, took
away a game with them, the score being 8 to 2.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two drubbings in two successive weeks,&rdquo; exclaimed
Kindlings. &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing we&rsquo;ve got to do is to improve in
pitching,&rdquo; declared the coach, and when some one
brought word of this to Tom his heart, that had
been heavy during the two weeks of suspension,
grew lighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll get a chance,&rdquo; he said to Sid. &ldquo;It
would make up for everything if I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one wants to see you in the box any more
than I do, old chap,&rdquo; spoke Sid fervently.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h3>AT THE DANCE</h3>


<p>It was the night of the junior dance, an annual
affair second only in importance to commencement
and a function attended, as Holly Cross used to say,
&ldquo;by all the beauty and chivalry of Haddonfield and
all points north, south, east and west.&rdquo; On this
occasion all strictly partisan college feelings were
laid aside. Forgotten were the grudges engendered
by hazings or the rivalries of the field. It
was an evening devoted to pleasure, and, on the
part of the juniors at least, to seeing that their girl
friends and acquaintances danced to their hearts&rsquo;
content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; cried Sid as they were dressing in their
room, &ldquo;does this dress suit seem to fit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it might be a little larger across the
shoulders,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s answer as he turned around
from an attempt to get his tie just right and surveyed
his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. I&rsquo;m outgrowing it.
I&rsquo;m afraid it will split when I&rsquo;m dancing, and I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
be a pretty sight, won&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ll disgrace the girl.
Hang it all, I hate a dress suit. I always remind
myself of some new specimen of a bug, and I think
some entomological professor will come along, run
a pin through me and impale me on a cork. In
fact I&rsquo;d just as soon he would as to go through this
agony again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. You&rsquo;ll enjoy it,&rdquo; ventured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;after it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he managed somehow to wiggle himself
into the garments and then, having asked a girl
to the affair, he set off after her in a coach he had
hired. Tom had not invited any one, but he heard
that Miss Tyler was to be there and from the same
source of information he knew that Langridge was
to escort her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; reflected Tom, &ldquo;I shall probably
not have a chance to dance with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gymnasium had been turned into a ballroom.
Around the gallery, which contained the indoor
running track, flags and bunting had been festooned,
the colors of Randall being prominent.
From the center electric chandelier long streamers
of ribbon of the mingled hues of each class were
draped to the boxes that had been constructed on
two sides of the room. There was a profusion of
flowers and with the soft glow of the shaded lights
the big apartment that was wont to resound to the
blows of the punching bag, the bound of the medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ball or the patter of running feet was most
magically transformed.</p>

<p>Over in one corner, screened by a bank of palms,
was the orchestra, the musicians of which were tuning
their instruments in thrilling chords which always
tell of joys to come.</p>

<p>The guests were arriving. Bewildering bevies
of pretty girls floated in with their escorts, who
showed the tan and bronze of the sporting field or
the whiter hue of a &ldquo;dig&rdquo; who spent most of his
time over his books. Then came the chaperons,
grave, dignified, in rustling silks, a strange contrast
to the light, fluffy garments worn by the
younger set.</p>

<p>Tom felt rather lonesome as he strolled out on
the waxed floor, for most of his chums had girls to
whom they were attentive, and of course they could
not be expected to look after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Parsons!&rdquo; called a voice, and he turned
to see one of the Jersey twins. Which one it was
he could not determine, for if Jerry and Joe Jackson
looked alike when in their ball suits or ordinary
clothes, there was even less of difference when
they wore formal black, with the expanse of shirt
showing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; responded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jerry,&rdquo; went on the twin. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d
tell you. My brother and I are going to play a
joke to-night.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s going to get talking to a girl and then he&rsquo;s
going to excuse himself for a moment. I&rsquo;ll take
his place and I&rsquo;ll pretend I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s
talking about when the girl tries to continue the
conversation. I&rsquo;ll make believe I&rsquo;ve come back to
the wrong girl. Great, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, except maybe for the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll beg her pardon afterward. Got to
have some fun. I&rsquo;m on the arrangement committee
and I&rsquo;m nearly crazy seeing that every one has a
good time. Got your name down on all the cards
you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t it on any yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? That&rsquo;s a shame! Come on and I&rsquo;ll fix
you up,&rdquo; and the good-natured Jerry dragged Tom
about, introducing him to an entrancing quartet
of pretty girls and then Tom knew enough to do
the rest, which included scribbling his name down
for a whole or a half dance as the case might be.</p>

<p>He had just finished this very satisfactory work
when he heard his name called and turned to see
Miss Tyler smiling at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad to see you,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
starting impulsively toward her with outstretched
hand. &ldquo;May I have a dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo; she asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of them, if you can spare them,&rdquo; he said
boldly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Greedy boy! I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re too late. You
may look,&rdquo; and she held out her card.</p>

<p>Tom, with regret, saw that it contained the initials
&ldquo;F. L.&rdquo; in many places. There was only one
two-step vacant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one else has been greedy, too,&rdquo; he said as
he filled in the space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she demanded, and she made a
little pout. &ldquo;How dare he think I&rsquo;m going to give
all those to him!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Here, Tom,
let me have your pencil. I never can write with the
ridiculous affairs they attach to dance programs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She used the lead vigorously on the card and
then let Tom see it again. His name was in three
places, and, to his surprise, on the last waltz he saw
that the girl had written his initials under those of
Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that I&rsquo;m going to share the last dance
with you,&rdquo; she almost whispered, &ldquo;in memory of
old times,&rdquo; and she nodded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget now,&rdquo;
and she shook her finger at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I would!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>The music began a march as the opening of the
dance and the couples took their places, Langridge
coming up almost on the run to claim Miss Tyler.
He looked sharply at Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, dominie?&rdquo; he asked with a nod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
intended to be friendly, and then he led the girl
away.</p>

<p>Tom had no partner for the march and he stood
about disconsolately until the first dance. Then
he went to claim his partner, whom Jerry Jackson
had secured for him, a pretty little girl in a yellow
dress who was a fine dancer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had another open date&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I
mean that you could give me another dance,&rdquo; he
corrected himself quickly from the language of the
ball field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; she said simply, and she gave him a
quick glance, for Tom was a fine dancer.</p>

<p>He scribbled his name down and then had to relinquish
her to another partner. Two dances after
that, however, Tom was privileged to claim Miss
Tyler. As he was leading her into the waltz Langridge
came hurrying up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought this was my dance, Madge&mdash;Miss
Tyler,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to vary the monotony,&rdquo; she said with
a little laugh that had no malice in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your arm, dominie?&rdquo; she asked of Tom,
looking up into his face and smiling as she gave him
the nickname conferred on him by Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, much better,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;How did you
hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the proverbial bird, I suppose. You had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to stay away from class two weeks on account of it,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom quickly, &ldquo;not on <i>that</i> account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, struck by the change in Tom&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I heard so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Langridge tell you that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was her answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was partly on that account,&rdquo; and Tom
turned the conversation away from what he considered
a dangerous subject.</p>

<p>If Langridge cherished any ill will toward Tom
for taking away Miss Tyler the &rsquo;varsity pitcher did
not show it. But Tom noticed that he was not far
from the girl&rsquo;s side the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she doesn&rsquo;t believe what I told her
about him,&rdquo; thought Tom. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going
to say anything more. Let her find out for herself.
Only&mdash;well, what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; and he went to claim
another dance elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was the last waltz. Around the brilliant,
gaily decorated room swung the dancers to the
strains of the enthralling music. Langridge skilfully
led Miss Tyler in and out among the maze of
couples. The music turned into another melody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think this is about half,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you were so greedy,&rdquo; she explained,
laughter in her eyes, &ldquo;that I had to punish you. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
gave half this last dance to&mdash;to the dominie,&rdquo; and
her lips parted in a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; spluttered Langridge, but
just then Tom, who had been summoned from the
&ldquo;side lines&rdquo; by a signal from Miss Tyler, came to
claim her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like your nerve, Parsons!&rdquo; snapped Langridge,
glad to be able to transfer his wrath to a
foeman more worthy of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my doing, Mr. Langridge,&rdquo; said the
girl with some dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had no right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the &rsquo;varsity
pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy Miss Tyler is the best judge of that,&rdquo;
spoke Tom coolly as he took the girl&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; sneered Langridge. &ldquo;Maybe she
knows who brought her to this affair then! If she
does, she can find some one else to take her away,&rdquo;
and he swung off.</p>

<p>For an instant Miss Tyler stood looking at him.
The dancers whirled around the couple standing
there and the music sounded sweetly. There was
the suspicion of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had no right to say that!&rdquo; she burst out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;But, since he has,
may I have the honor of being your escort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and then, with a revulsion of
feeling, she added, &ldquo;Oh, Tom, I don&rsquo;t feel like
dancing now. Take me home, please!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<h3>DRESS SUITS COME HIGH</h3>


<p>So after all, Tom did not get the last half of
the last waltz with Miss Tyler. He did not much
care, however, for, as matters turned out, he had a
longer time in her company. The girl soon recovered
her usual spirits and the walk to where she
was stopping with relatives in Haddonfield seemed
all too short to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be at the game Saturday?&rdquo; he asked
as they were about to part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over at Fairview. Our team is going to try
and run up a big score against them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then won&rsquo;t you please think now?&rdquo; pleaded
Tom, with an odd air of patheticness, at which
Miss Tyler laughed gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I shan&rsquo;t find that so <i>very</i> difficult,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you think real hard, can you get a mental
picture of your humble servant taking you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that game?&rdquo; Tom was very much in earnest,
though his air was bantering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she answered tantalizingly, &ldquo;I do seem
to see a sort of hazy painting to that effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! It will grow more distinct with time.
I&rsquo;ll call for you, then. A number of the boys are
going to charter a little steamer and sail down the
river, and into the lake. We&rsquo;ll land at a point
about four miles from Fairview, and go over in
some automobiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be jolly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so. Is the picture any
clearer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, much so. I think the autos have cleared
away the mist. Aren&rsquo;t we silly, though?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; declared Tom stoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be on hand here for you, then, shortly after lunch
on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the nine going that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom felt a sudden suspicion. Was she asking
because she wanted to know whether Langridge
would be in the party of merrymakers?</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think they&rsquo;re going in a big stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe you might want to be with the
nine,&rdquo; she went on, and Tom saw that he had misunderstood.
&ldquo;You might get a chance to pitch,&rdquo;
and she looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; replied Tom, trying to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
cheerfully, but finding it hard work. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll
say good-night, or, rather, good-morning. When
I write home I must tell my folks about meeting
you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do. I&rsquo;ve already written to mine, telling
what a fine time I&rsquo;m having.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was rather thoughtful on his way home.
He stumbled into his dark room, nearly falling
over something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Sid, who was in
bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rdquo; replied Tom,
striking a match. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep your patent
leathers out of the middle of the floor?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, Tommy, me lad, as Bricktop Molloy
would say, but I had to throw them out there
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mice. Two of the cute little chaps sitting in
the middle of the floor, eating some nuts that
dropped out of my pocket. I stretched out on the
bed without undressing when I came in from the
dance, and must have fallen asleep, with the light
burning. When I woke up I saw the mice staring
at me, and I heaved my shoes at the beggars, for
I&rsquo;d taken &rsquo;em off&mdash;my shoes, I mean&mdash;when I came
in, as my feet hurt from dancing so much. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I doused the glim and turned in, for I knew you
wouldn&rsquo;t be along until daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw you going off with her. I admire
your taste, old man, but it must be hard on Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his own fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I understand. I heard about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; murmured Tom, for he did not want to
talk about Miss Tyler and her affairs&mdash;at least
not yet. There are some things that one likes to
ponder over, and think about&mdash;all alone.</p>

<p>The game with Fairview was looked forward to
with more than ordinary interest, for the season
was about half over, and a partial estimate could
be made of the chances for the championship. Up
to this time the three teams in the league had been
running nearly even, with Randall, if anything, a
trifle in the lead, not so much regarding the number
of games won, but counting form. In the last
two weeks, however, Fairview and Boxer had been
doing some hard work, and in games between those
colleges Fairview had some the best of it. If, on
the occasion that was approaching, Randall won, it
would put her nine in the lead, and if, on the contrary,
she lost it would mean that she would be the
&ldquo;tail-ender,&rdquo; though only a few points behind
Boxer, which would be second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to win!&rdquo; declared Sid, one afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
following a severe game with the scrub, who
had played the &rsquo;varsity to a tie in eleven innings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted the coach. &ldquo;But I
think we will. We have improved all around
lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was true, more especially in the case of
Langridge. Since the affair of the junior dance he
had not spoken to Tom, and had taken pains to
avoid him. But the &rsquo;varsity pitcher was certainly
doing better work.</p>

<p>The day before the game with Fairview, Coach
Lighton called Tom to one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better prepare to go as a sub
to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, is Langridge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; burst out Tom, a
wild hope filling his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t our pitcher. But I understand Sid
is falling back in his Latin, and he may not be allowed
to play. In that case I&rsquo;ll have to do some
shifting, and I <i>may</i> be able to give you a place in
the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want to see Sid left, but I would
like a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was in rather a quandary. He had arranged
to take Miss Tyler, and he could not, if he
went with the team as a sub. He hardly knew
what to do about it, and was on the point of going
over to see her, and explain, when Sid came bursting
into the room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood! blood! I want blood!&rdquo; he cried as he
threw his Latin grammar against the wall with
such force that the covers came off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho! most worthy knight!&rdquo; replied Tom
gently. &ldquo;In sooth, gentle sir, what hath befallen
thee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaps!&rdquo; replied Sid. &ldquo;Oh, Pitchfork, would
I had thee here!&rdquo; and he wadded up the table
cover, and pretended to choke it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he put me through a course of sprouts for
further orders this afternoon,&rdquo; explained Sid.
&ldquo;Thought he&rsquo;d catch me, but I managed to wiggle
through. Nearly gave me heart disease, though,
for fear I&rsquo;d have to be out of the game to-morrow.
But I managed to save myself, much to the surprise
of Pitchfork. Now I want my revenge on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;nothing, I guess. I wish&mdash;hold
on!&rdquo; Sid struck a thoughtful attitude, looked
fixedly at the floor, then at the ceiling, and finally
cried: &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has some one been playing hob with your
crown?&rdquo; asked Tom, referring to the exclamation
said to have been made by the ancient king, when
he discovered, in his bath, a means of finding out
if his jeweler had cheated him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve found a way to get even with
Pitchfork.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, and I will a tale unfold&mdash;a spike-tail at
that. When I was coming in from recitation, disgusted
with life in general, and with the Roman
view of it, particularly, I met Wallops the messenger.
He had a bundle under his arm, and you
know what a talker he is. Confided to me that he
was taking Pitchfork&rsquo;s best suit to the tailor&rsquo;s to
be pressed, and his dress-suit to have new buttons
put on, and some other fixings done. Pitchfork is
going to a swell reception to-night, and will wear
his glad rags. All he has now is his classroom suit,
and you know what that is&mdash;all chalk and chemical
stains when he goes into the laboratory once in a
while on the relief shift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon. See, as it stands now Pitchfork
is without a decent suit he can wear, and he&rsquo;s
such a peculiar build that no other professor&rsquo;s garments
will fit him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when he wants his dress-suit to go to the
blow-out to-night, he&rsquo;s going to learn something
new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just this. That dress-suits come high this time
of the year! It&rsquo;s going to be the best joke yet.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, with your kind permission
and attention I will endeavor to give you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
correct imitation of Professor Pitchfork hunting
high and low for his glad rags&mdash;particularly high.
I will roll back my cuffs, to show you that I have
nothing concealed up my sleeves. Now, commodore,
a little slow music, please,&rdquo; and Sid, who had
assumed the rle of a vaudeville performer, pretended
to nod to an imaginary leader of an orchestra.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<h3>TOM IN A GAME</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Want any help?&rdquo; asked Tom, when Sid had
outlined his scheme of &ldquo;revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not, until I get ready to pull the
strings. Then you can give me a hand. We&rsquo;ll
have to do it after dark, and be mighty careful not
to be caught, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how are you going to get the suit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a plan. Watch your Uncle Dudley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid spent the rest of the afternoon in making up
a bundle to look like one that contained two suits
just from the tailor shop. Only, in place of clothes
he used old newspapers. It was toward dusk when
he went out with it under his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time Wallops was coming back,&rdquo; he
said to Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet him in the clump of elms,
where it&rsquo;s good and dark, and he can&rsquo;t tell who I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned his roommate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. But I know what I&rsquo;m about. Revenge is
sweet! Wow! Wait until you see the face of
Pitchfork!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid stole carefully along to a spot near the edge
of the river, where a clump of big elm trees grew.
This was near the bridge on the road to Haddonfield.
The spot was lonely and deserted enough at
this hour to suit his purpose, and the dusk of the
evening, being added to by clouds, and by the
shadows of the trees, made concealment easy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s Wallops,&rdquo; murmured Sid as he
peered out from behind a tree. &ldquo;That walks like
Wallops, and he&rsquo;s got a bundle under his arm.
Now for a grand transformation scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Awaiting the psychological moment, Sid hurried
out, and bumped into the college messenger. Wallops&rsquo;
bundle was knocked from under his arm, and,
by a strange coincidence, so was Sid&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; exclaimed the student in
an assumed voice. &ldquo;Awfully careless of me, I&rsquo;m
sure. I beg a thousand pardons! I was in a hurry,
and I didn&rsquo;t notice you. Is this the road to Haddonfield?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied Wallops good naturedly
as his pardon was begged again. &ldquo;Yes,
keep straight on, and you&rsquo;ll come to the trolley that
runs to Haddonfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me restore your bundle to you,&rdquo; went on
Sid, picking up both parcels.</p>

<p>He handed one to the messenger, and kept one
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas yours, &rsquo;tis mine; &rsquo;twas his, &rsquo;tis ours,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
paraphrased. &ldquo;Again let me express my sincere
sorrow at this happening. I trust there was nothing
in your package that could be damaged when I
knocked it from your grasp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing but some clothes of one of the college
professors. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure my package isn&rsquo;t damaged,&rdquo; said
Sid, in a queer voice, as he hurried away.</p>

<p>A little later he was telling Tom, with much
mirth, how it all came about. The two, in the seclusion
of their room, opened the bundle, and saw
two suits, one full dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he howl when he finds nothing but a lot
of newspapers!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid. &ldquo;Now for the rest
of the trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll borrow a dress suit from some student,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Sid. &ldquo;I thought
of that, and I forwarded a message by wireless to
all the dormitories that if Pitchfork sent around to
borrow some glad rags, he was to be refused on
some pretext or other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid&rsquo;s precaution was well taken. A little later it
was evident that something unusual had occurred.
Wallops and several other college messengers were
seen hurrying first to the rooms of one professor,
then to the apartments of another. Each time the
scouts came back empty-handed to that part of the
faculty residence where Professor Tines dwelt.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew they had no spike-tails that would fit
him,&rdquo; exulted Sid. &ldquo;Besides, most of them are going
to the reception themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was consternation in the apartments of
Professor Tines. Wallops had delivered to him
the bundle of papers, and when the astonished instructor
had threatened and questioned him, the
unfortunate messenger could only say it was the
package he had received from the tailor. That
worthy, on being appealed to by telephone, declared
that he had sent home the professor&rsquo;s garments.
Wallops had no idea that the stranger he
met in the wood had played a transformation trick
on him, and Professor Tines, in his anxiety to get
dressed, and go to the reception, did not dream
that it was a student prank. Rather he blamed the
tailor, and made up his mind to sue the man for
heavy damages.</p>

<p>Then, just as Sid had expected, the instructor
endeavored to borrow a dress-suit from one of the
students. But they had been warned, and were
either going to wear their suits themselves, or had
just sent them to the tailor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; wailed Professor Tines. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t go in this suit,&rdquo; and he looked at his acid-and-chalk-marked
classroom garments. &ldquo;Yet I
was to read a paper on early Roman life at this reception.
It is too provoking. I can&rsquo;t understand
why none of the students have a suit available.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have one of mine, only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began
Dr. Churchill as he looked first at the figure of the
professor, and then at himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it
wouldn&rsquo;t fit,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, of course not!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tines
distractedly. &ldquo;I will telephone that rascally tailor
again. Never, never shall he press another suit of
mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the knight of the goose and needle insisted
that the professor&rsquo;s clothes had been sent home,
and that was all there was to it. Mr. Tines could
not go to the reception, and, as it was an important
affair, where nearly all of the faculty was expected
to be present, he was grievously disappointed.</p>

<p>When all was quiet that night a party of students,
including Sid and Tom, stole out to the campus.
They worked quickly and silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, when all was finished.
&ldquo;I rather guess that will astonish him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning the attention of most of the college
students, and several of the faculty, was attracted
to a throng of passersby staring up at the
flagstaff. They would halt, point upward, make
some remarks, and then, laughing, pass on. Some
one called the attention of Dr. Churchill to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he prepared
to go out. &ldquo;I hope none of the students have
put the flag at half mast or upside down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put on his far-seeing spectacles, and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
out on the campus. There, at the top of the pole,
was a figure which looked like a man, with outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What student has dared climb up there?&rdquo; exclaimed
the head of the college. &ldquo;Send for Mr.
Zane at once,&rdquo; he added to Professor Newton, who
had accompanied him. &ldquo;He must be severely punished&mdash;the
venturesome student, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly think that is a student,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Newton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say it is some outsider?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is no one at all, Dr. Churchill. I believe
it is an effigy. See how stiff the arms and
legs are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; admitted the venerable
doctor.</p>

<p>His belief was confirmed a moment later, for a
farmer, who was driving along the river road, left
his team, and came up the campus, a broad smile
covering his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Dr. Churchill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is
this a new course in eddercation you&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; the
boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, good-morning, Mr. Oakes. What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I see you&rsquo;ve got a scarecrow up on that
liberty pole. I thought maybe you was addin&rsquo; a
course in agriculture to your studies. Only if I
was you I wouldn&rsquo;t put a scarecrow up so high.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
There ain&rsquo;t no need of it. One low down will do
jest as well. And another thing, I allers uses old
clothes. There ain&rsquo;t no sense in puttin&rsquo; a swallertail
coat an&rsquo; a low-cut vest on a scarecrow. Them
birds will be jest as skeert of an old coat and a pair
of pants stuffed with straw as they will of a dress-suit.
That&rsquo;s carryin&rsquo; things a leetle too fur!&rdquo; and
the farmer laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dress-suit! Scarecrow!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Churchill,
and then he got a glimpse of the figure on top
of the pole. It was arrayed in a full-dress suit, and
Professor Tines, coming out a moment later, beheld
his missing garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an outrage!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I demand
the instant dismissal of the student or students responsible
for this, Dr. Churchill!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#image03">Dr. Churchill</a> tried hard not to smile, but he <a href="#image03">had
to turn his face away</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<a name="image03" id="image03"><img src="images/image03.jpg" width="379" height="600" alt="DR. CHURCHILL HAD TO TURN HIS FACE AWAY" title="DR. CHURCHILL HAD TO TURN HIS FACE AWAY" /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_222">DR. CHURCHILL HAD TO TURN HIS FACE AWAY</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I am greatly obliged to you, Mr. Oakes, for
your information,&rdquo; said the head of the college to
the farmer, who was still laughing. &ldquo;Our improvised
scarecrow shall be taken down at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scarecrow!&rdquo; exclaimed Professor Tines. &ldquo;I
think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But wrath choked his utterance. &ldquo;I
demand that my suit be taken down at once!&rdquo; he
went on, after a pause, &ldquo;and that the guilty ones
be punished!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shall be, I assure you,&rdquo; promised Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Churchill, &ldquo;when I learn who they are. If you
hear, professor, let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall. But I want my suit. Perhaps it is
ruined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a new difficulty now arose, for Sid and his
fellow conspirators had fastened the halyards high
up on the pole, and it was not until Professor Tines
had sent Wallops for a ladder that the ropes could
be untied and the suit lowered. During this process
a group of students gathered at a respectful
distance from the flagstaff and looked on interestedly.</p>

<p>But, though a strict inquiry was made, no one
was ever punished for the &ldquo;scarecrow joke&rdquo; as it
came to be called, and it is now one of the traditions
of Randall College.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that Sid had &ldquo;made good&rdquo; in
Latin he was not barred from the game that day,
and there was no chance for Tom to act as substitute.
He went with Miss Tyler, and the trip on
the river, lake, and in the auto was a delightful one.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd on the bleachers and
grandstand when the nines began to play, and
rivalry in singing college songs, giving college yells
and waving college colors ran high.</p>

<p>Randall got two runs in the first inning, and for
three more Fairview secured only zeros. Langridge
was pitching fine ball. Then Lem Sellig, who
was doing the &ldquo;twirling&rdquo; for Fairview, seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
warm up to his work, and struck out a surprising
number of men. In the seventh inning Fairview
secured five runs, and in the eighth they reeled off
five more, for Langridge grew reckless, and not
only gave men their bases on balls in rapid succession,
but struck two men, which gave them free
passes to first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to pieces!&rdquo; exclaimed Coach Lighton
as he saw the score piling up against his men.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to stop, or we&rsquo;ll be the laughing stock of
the league.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet he did not like to take Langridge out. Captain
Woodhouse was angry clear through, and as
for Kerr, he openly insulted the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; the catcher cried after a
particularly bad series of balls and a fumble on the
part of Langridge that let in a run. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rotten
to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge flushed, but his face had been rosy-hued
before that, and twice he had gone to the
dressing rooms, whence he came odorous of cloves.</p>

<p>Then the &ldquo;rooters&rdquo; seeing their game took up
cries of derision against the pitcher, in an endeavor
to &ldquo;get his goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge bit his lips and threw in a fierce ball.
There were two out, but it looked as if it would go
on that way indefinitely. Frank Sullivan, a good
batter, hit it fairly, but Joe Jackson, out in left
field, made a desperate run for it, and got the ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
It was a sensational catch, and was roundly applauded.</p>

<p>When Randall came to the bat for the last time
the score was 12 to 2 in favor of their opponents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; said Kindlings hopelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but for the love of Mike, don&rsquo;t let them
roll up any bigger score against us, or they&rsquo;ll put us
out of the league,&rdquo; begged Bricktop Molloy.
&ldquo;Speak to Langridge, and tell him to hold hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use speaking to him?&rdquo; asked Kerr
gloomily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll go off his handle if I do. He
told me never to speak to him again, just because I
called him down a bit. Land knows he needed it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make a change,&rdquo; decided the
coach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let Langridge pitch next inning.
If he does I&rsquo;ll resign, and I&rsquo;ll tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked over to the pitcher, and soon the two
were in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>Randall could not make another run, for Sellig
was doing his best and they did not get a hit off
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our only chance is to strike them out,&rdquo; murmured
Kerr as he arose from the bench to take his
place. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to pitch, Mr. Lighton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Parsons? What&rsquo;s the matter with our
regular substitute, Evert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His arm is no good and he&rsquo;s out of practice.
I&rsquo;m going to put Tom in.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>And much to his astonishment Tom was summoned
from the grandstand, where he was talking
to Miss Tyler about the slump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me pitch? Are you sure Mr. Lighton sent you
for me?&rdquo; he asked Jerry Jackson, who had brought
the message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Come on and get into part of a uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do go,&rdquo; urged Miss Tyler. &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope
you beat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for that now,&rdquo; replied Tom sadly
as he walked down from the stand.</p>

<p>A little later he was in the box, facing Roger
Barns, one of the best hitters on the Fairview
team. Tom was nervous, there is no denying that,
but he held himself well in control. It was the goal
of his ambition&mdash;to pitch on the &rsquo;varsity, and he
was now realizing it. True, it was almost an
empty honor, but he resolved to do his best, and
this thought steeled his nerves, even though the
crowd hooted at him.</p>

<p>And he struck out the first three men up, at
which his college chums went wild, for it was all
they had to rejoice over in the game.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h3>THE FRESHMAN DINNER</h3>


<p>They wanted Tom to ride back to the college
with the team and the substitutes, but he would not
leave Miss Tyler, and, though he was torn between
two desires, he went back to the girl.</p>

<p>Moreover, he had an idea that it would not be altogether
pleasant riding in the same stage with
Langridge, who, he had heard whispered, made
strenuous objection when Coach Lighton ordered
him to give place to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be down on me more than ever,&rdquo; thought
Tom as he made his way back to the grandstand,
which was rapidly emptying. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t
help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your arm must be much better,&rdquo; remarked
Miss Tyler as Tom came up to her. &ldquo;You pitched
finely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of practice,&rdquo; was his answer.
&ldquo;I fancy Langridge was tired out,&rdquo; he added
generously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fun to pitch a losing game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it was my first chance on the &rsquo;varsity,
and I would have welcomed it if the score had been
a hundred to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you pitch regularly now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom stopped. He had almost forgotten that
Miss Tyler was very friendly to Langridge, in
spite of the little scene at the dance.</p>

<p>For two days after the disastrous game with
Fairview Langridge sulked in his room and would
not report for practice. He talked somewhat
wildly about Tom, the latter heard, and practically
accused him of being responsible for his disgrace.
He even said Tom was intriguing against him to
win away his friends; meaning Kerr especially, for
the &rsquo;varsity catcher announced that he was done
with Langridge as far as sociability was concerned.
But Kerr, hearing this, came to Tom&rsquo;s defense, and
stated openly that it was Langridge himself who
was to blame.</p>

<p>Mr. Lighton would stand for no nonsense, and
ordered Evert into the pitcher&rsquo;s box, promising
that Tom should have the next chance. He would
have made Tom the regular substitute but for the
fact that Evert, by right of seniority, was entitled
to it. Hearing this news, Langridge came out of
his sulks and resumed practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a large framed picture of Randall winning
the league pennant,&rdquo; announced Sid gloomily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
one night as he and Tom were sitting in their room.
&ldquo;Our stock is about fifty below par now, and with
only a few more games to play, we&rsquo;ve practically
got to win them all in order to top the league.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Tom, in an endeavor
to be cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might, if you pitched, but Langridge is that
mean that he&rsquo;ll keep in just good enough form so
Mr. Lighton won&rsquo;t send him to the bench, and
that&rsquo;s all. He won&rsquo;t do his best&mdash;no, I&rsquo;ll not say
that. He is doing his best, but&mdash;well, something&rsquo;s
wrong, and I guess I&rsquo;m not the only one who
knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom quietly. &ldquo;I do and have for
some time. It&rsquo;s been a puzzle to know what to do;
keep still and let the &rsquo;varsity be beaten or squeal
on Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, one can&rsquo;t squeal, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s what I thought, especially in my
case. It would look as if I was grinding my own
ax.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. No, you can&rsquo;t say anything. But
it&rsquo;s tough luck. Maybe something will turn up.
We&rsquo;ve got a couple of games on our own grounds
next, and we may do better. If we don&rsquo;t, we may
as well order our funeral outfits. Well, I&rsquo;m going
to bone away at this confounded Latin. Ten thousand
maledictions be upon the head of the Roman
who invented it!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid opened his book, and studied for half an
hour. Tom likewise was busily engaged, and only
the ticking of the clock was heard, when suddenly
there came a gentle tap on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yellow, sky-blue and maroon,&rdquo; was the reply,
which indicated that a freshman was without, that
being the password.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flagpole,&rdquo; answered Sid, which being translated
meant that it was safe to enter, no member of
the faculty nor scout of the proctor&rsquo;s being nigh.</p>

<p>Dutch Housenlager pushed open the portal and
entered. He looked carefully around, and then,
coming on tiptoe to the middle of the room, after
having carefully shut the door, said in a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all arranged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, kind sir,&rdquo; retorted Sid, with a shake
of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay nay what?&rdquo; demanded Dutch indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No tricks to-night,&rdquo; went on Sid. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re two
virtuous young men. We belong to the ancient and
honorable order of <i>infra digs</i> to-night, Dutch. Too
near the exams. Thus did I exclaim &lsquo;nay, nay,
kind sir.&rsquo; We are not to be tempted, nay, even if
it were to take mine ancient enemy, Pitchfork, and
drop him into the lake; eh, Tom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t afford to take any chances.
Twice bitten once shy, or words to that effect, you
know. I, too, am delving into the hidden paths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that lead to the spring of which the poet doth
sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you two give me a sore feeling in the cranium!&rdquo;
exclaimed Dutch as he sank into the easy
chair with force enough almost to disrupt it.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s asking you to play any tricks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Fiat justitia, ruat c&#339;lum!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Tom,
with mock heroics. &ldquo;We have done you an injustice,
most noble Dutchman. Say on, and we will
hear thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good notion not to,&rdquo; said Housenlager a
bit sulkily. &ldquo;Here I come in to tell you fellows a
piece of news, and I find you boning away, and
when I start to talk you spout Latin mottoes at me.
I&rsquo;ve a good notion to dig out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay! Stay, dear friend!&rdquo; cried Tom, laughing.
&ldquo;There, we&rsquo;ll chuck studying for to-night,
eh, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;m sick of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, say on,&rdquo; invited Tom.</p>

<p>Somewhat mollified, Dutch took an easier position
in the creaking chair, thereby raising a cloud
of dust, and remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the freshman dinner will come off to-morrow
night. It&rsquo;s just been decided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo; cried Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Our committee has everything in shape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and we&rsquo;ll fool the sophs this time. Ford Fenton
and I have been going around notifying the fellows.
You see, we had to keep it quiet, because
those sophs will put it on the blink if they can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure they will,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Where is it
to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, for there was the sound
of footsteps in the hall outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one is spying,&rdquo; whispered Sid. Softly he
opened the door and then he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Fenton,&rdquo;
he said as the other entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All through?&rdquo; asked Dutch of his partner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t believe the sophs suspect. A few
years ago, when the freshmen had a dinner, the
sophs ate it all up, and my uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom significantly reached for a heavy book, and
Ford, with a disappointed look, stopped his reminiscence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be in Cardigan Hall, in town,&rdquo; explained
Dutch, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll start from here in a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused in a listening attitude and tiptoed
over to the door. Throwing the portal open suddenly,
he darted into the hall, the others crowding
up close to see what was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one was out there,&rdquo; declared Dutch as he
came back, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t catch him. Maybe it
was only one of our boys, though. Now I&rsquo;ll tell
you the plans,&rdquo; and he proceeded to go into them
into detail, telling Tom and Sid where to join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
other freshmen the next night, in order to steal
away to Haddonfield and hold their banquet undisturbed
by the sophomores.</p>

<p>Tom and Sid promised to be on hand, and the
two members of the committee departed, Ford
Fenton being unable to tell what it was his uncle
had said. As Tom saw their guests to the door,
something bright and shining in the hall attracted
his attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matchbox,&rdquo; he remarked as he picked it
up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got initials on, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;look like H. E. G.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horace E. Gladdus,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;I wonder if
he was sneaking around here trying to catch on
about the dinner?&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<h3>TOM IS KIDNAPPED</h3>


<p>For a moment Tom looked at Sid. The same
thought was in both their minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had we better tell Dutch?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll let him know. If Gladdus and
his crowd find out our plans they&rsquo;ll spoil &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Tom hastened after Dutch Housenlager and
related the finding of the matchbox and the suspicion
engendered by it&mdash;that Gladdus had been
listening in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; remarked Dutch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll change
our plans a bit. I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and Sid did not feel like resuming their
studies after what had happened. Instead they
sat talking of the prospective dinner, Sid stretched
lazily at full length on the sofa, while Tom luxuriously
sprawled in the easy chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, old man,&rdquo; said Sid, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
mighty comfortable here, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And to think that next term we&rsquo;ll have to go
into the west dormitory,&rdquo; went on Sid. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
bloomin&rsquo; sophs then. At least you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice of you to say so, but what
about yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; and Sid spoke dubiously.
&ldquo;That confounded Latin will be the death of me.
I tell you what it is. I was never cut out for a
classical scholar. Now, if they had a course of
what to do on first base, I&rsquo;d be able to master it in,
say, a four years&rsquo; stretch. But I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll go
the way of our mutual acquaintance Langridge,
and spend two years as a freshman, at which rate
I&rsquo;ll be eight years getting through college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not. You stand better than Langridge.
He&rsquo;s smart&mdash;not that you aren&rsquo;t&mdash;but he
doesn&rsquo;t get down to it. It&rsquo;s just like his baseball
practice, if he would only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tom stopped. He didn&rsquo;t want to talk
about the player whom he was trying to supplant
on the nine. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll
turn in. We&rsquo;ll have to see Dutch in the morning
and learn what the new plans are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Housenlager and his fellow members of the
freshman dinner committee found it advisable to
make a change after what Sid and Tom had discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t alter the time or place of the
feed,&rdquo; explained Dutch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to do that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Anyway, there&rsquo;s no danger once we get inside the
hall, for we&rsquo;ve arranged to have the doors bolted
and braced and guards posted. The only danger
is that they&rsquo;ll get at some of us before we get to
the place or that they&rsquo;ll get at the eating stuff in
some way and put it on the blink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;d be much danger of
that,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the man who is going
to supply it look out for that end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose he will,&rdquo; admitted Dutch, &ldquo;so the main
thing for us to do is to see that we get safely to
the hall. I think we&rsquo;d better not meet down near
the bridge, as I proposed first. You know, we were
all going in a body. I think now the best way will
be for us to stroll off by ones and twos. Then
there won&rsquo;t be any suspicion. The sophs will be
on the watch for us, of course, but I think we can
fool them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you mean for each one of us to get to the
hall as best he can?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some fellows did that one year,&rdquo; put in Ford
Fenton, &ldquo;but the sophs caught them just the same.
My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, for the group of lads about him, as
if by prearranged signal, all put their hands over
their ears and all began talking at once loudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu!&rdquo; ejaculated Ford. &ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s
funny, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as funny as what your uncle might have
said,&rdquo; remarked Sid, who some time previously
had planned to have his chums give this signal of
disapproval the moment Ford mentioned his relative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s all understood,&rdquo; went on
Dutch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a sort of go-as-you-please affair
until we get to the hall in Haddonfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear Langridge isn&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; said Ford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he did. I asked him if he was going to
be on hand, and I told him about a dinner where
my uncle said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he doesn&rsquo;t want to come because he is
afraid your uncle will be there,&rdquo; declared Tom
with a good-natured laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More likely because the dinner isn&rsquo;t going to
be sporty enough for him,&rdquo; was the opinion of
Dutch. &ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t want anybody that
doesn&rsquo;t want to come. But I&rsquo;ve got to go and attend
to some loose ends. Now mind, mum&rsquo;s the
word, fellows, not only as regards talk, but don&rsquo;t
act so as to give the sophs a clue. See you later,&rdquo;
and he hurried off.</p>

<p>Few in the freshman class did themselves justice
in recitations that day from too much thinking
about the fun they would have at the dinner that
night. Even Tom fell below his usual standard,
and as for Sid, his rendering of Virgil was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to make Professor Tines (who was a good
classical scholar, whatever else he might be) shudder
in anguish. But Sid didn&rsquo;t mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, old man,&rdquo; spoke Sid to
Tom that evening as they prepared to leave for
the spread, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better go it alone, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I was about to propose. If we leave
here together, some sneaking soph will be sure to
spot us. Will you go first or shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take it first. There&rsquo;s a hole in
one of my socks I&rsquo;ve got to sew up. I never saw
clothes go the way they do when a laundry gets
hold of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you darn socks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly what you&rsquo;d call <i>darn</i>,&rdquo; explained
Sid. &ldquo;I just gather up a little of the sock
where the hole is and tie a string around it. It&rsquo;s
just as good as darning and twice as quick. I
learned that from a fellow I roomed with at boarding
school. But go ahead, if you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was quite dark now and Tom, after a cautious
look around the entrance of the dormitory, to see
if any sophomores were lurking about, stole silently
down toward the river. He intended to take the
road along the stream, cross the bridge and board
a trolley for Haddonfield, which plan would be followed
by a number of the freshmen.</p>

<p>Tom was almost at the bridge when he saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
number of dark shadows moving about near the
structure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, are they sophs or our fellows?&rdquo; he mused
as he cautiously halted. He thought he recognized
some of his classmates and went on a little further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes one!&rdquo; he heard in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>Tom stopped. It was so dark he could not tell
friends from foes. But he knew a test. A countersign
had been agreed upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did the namby-pamby say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Back came the answer in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the fence is out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the reply that had been arranged among
the freshmen. Confident that he was approaching
friends, Tom advanced. A moment later he found
himself clasped by half a dozen arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got one!&rdquo; some one cried, and he recognized
the voice of Gladdus. &ldquo;Take him away, fellows,
and wait for the next. I guess the freshies
won&rsquo;t have so many at their spread as they think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kidnapped!&rdquo; thought Tom disgustedly as he
was hustled away in the darkness. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ll
have the laugh on me and some of the other fellows
all right. They have discovered our countersign
or else some one gave it away.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<h3>THE ESCAPE</h3>


<p>After the first shock of surprise was over Tom
struggled against being taken away by his captors.
He almost succeeded in breaking loose, but so
many came at him, crowding close around him, that
by sheer weight of numbers they formed an impassable
barrier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, freshie, you&rsquo;re hooked good and
proper, so don&rsquo;t try to get away,&rdquo; advised a tall
youth whom he recognized as Battersby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Tom good-naturedly,
though he by no means intended to give up trying
to escape. But he would bide his time. &ldquo;Where
are you going to take me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a good place. You&rsquo;ll have plenty of company.
Take him along, fellows. I&rsquo;ll go back and
help capture some more. The idea of these freshies
thinking they could pull off a dinner without us
getting on to it. The very idea!&rdquo; and Battersby
laughed sarcastically. He and Gladdus had fully
recovered from the electric shocks and were probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
glad of a chance to make trouble for the freshmen.</p>

<p>Tom, in the midst of half a dozen sophomores,
was half led, half pushed along a dark path, over
the bridge and then down a walk which extended
through the woods. He recognized that he was
being taken toward a little summer resort on the
shores of the lake.</p>

<p>Once he thought he saw a chance to break loose
as the grips on his arms loosened slightly, but
when he attempted it he was handled so roughly
that he knew the sophomores had made up their
minds to hold on to him at any cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our first prisoner,&rdquo; explained one lad,
&ldquo;and for the moral effect of it we can&rsquo;t let you get
away. You&rsquo;ll have company soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later Tom was thrust into a small shanty.
He recognized the place as one that had been used
for a soda water and candy booth at the picnic
grounds, but which shack had not been opened this
season yet, though others near it were in use.
There was nothing doing at the grounds on this
night and the resort was deserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lock the door,&rdquo; exclaimed some one as Tom
was thrust inside. &ldquo;Then a few of us will have to
stand guard and the others can go back and help
bring up the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom staggered against some tables and chairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
in the dark interior of the shack. He managed to
find a place to sit down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a bright lot of lads,&rdquo; thought the scrub
pitcher, &ldquo;to be taken in after this fashion. We
should have stuck together and then we could have
fought off the sophs. But it&rsquo;s too late now. I
wonder if Sid was caught?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He listened and could hear the retreating steps
of his captors. That all had not gone and that
some were left on guard was indicated by the low
talk that went on outside and by the tramping
about the shack of several lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he get out?&rdquo; Tom heard some one ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. The place is nailed up tight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can&rsquo;t and maybe I can,&rdquo; mused Tom.
&ldquo;Anyhow I&rsquo;m going to have a look. Wait until I
strike a match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holding his hat as a protection, so that no
gleams would penetrate possible cracks in the door,
Tom struck a light and examined the walls of his
prison. The shack consisted of only one room and
was cluttered up with chairs, tables, benches, counters
and other things. Tom at once eliminated
from his plan of escape the front, as there he knew
the sophomores would remain on guard. He must
try either the sides or the back. The sides, he saw,
were out of the question, as they contained only
small windows, hardly big enough for him to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
through. In addition the casements were closed
by heavy wooden shutters, nailed fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use trying them,&rdquo; thought Tom. &ldquo;The
back is the only place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he examined with care, and to his delight
he saw what he thought would enable him to get
out. This was an opening near the top, and it was
closed by a thin wooden shutter swinging on a
hinge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nailed fast,&rdquo; Tom remarked when, by dint
of lighting many matches inside his hat, he had examined
the shutter. &ldquo;But I can reach it by standing
on two chairs, and if I can get it open, I can
crawl out and drop to the ground. But how am I
going to pull out those big nails?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed it did seem impossible, but Tom was ingenious.
His fingers, when he had thrust his
hands into his pockets, had touched his keen-bladed
knife, the one that had gotten him into trouble
about the wire and which had been returned to him
by the proctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can cut away the wood around the nails,&rdquo; he
thought, and at once he put his plan into operation.
He managed to get two chairs, one on top of the
other, and mounting upon this perch, he attacked
the shutter. Fortunately the wood was soft, and
working in the darkness by means of feeling with
his fingers around the nails, Tom soon had one
spike cut free of the shutter. Then he began on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
others, and in half an hour he could raise the solid
piece of wood. A breath of the fresh night air
came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No glass in it,&rdquo; he exclaimed softly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
good. Now to get away and show up at the dinner.
I hope they didn&rsquo;t get any other fellows.
They haven&rsquo;t brought any more here, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He listened at the door a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish some of our fellows would come back,&rdquo;
he heard one of the guards saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s lonesome here. I wonder if Parsons
is still there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure he is. How could he get away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. He couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; whispered Tom.</p>

<p>He again mounted the chairs, and pulling himself
up by the edge of the opening, after fastening
up the shutter, he prepared to crawl through and
drop down outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t much of a fall and that the
ground is soft,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>Just then he heard a commotion in front of the
shack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bringing up some more of our class,&rdquo;
he reasoned. &ldquo;Maybe I can help &rsquo;em. Had I better
stay in?&rdquo; He was undecided, and he remained
on the edge of the window, partly inside and partly
outside the shanty. He heard the door open, and
looking back in the semi-darkness, saw that a struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was going on. He guessed that the sophomores
were trying to thrust inside one or more
freshmen. Then another shout told Tom that his
escape was discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop down outside,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;and see
what I can do toward a rescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked down. In the gloom below the high
window was a figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, soph, I&rsquo;m going to drop on you!&rdquo;
cried Tom warningly. He heard a half-smothered
exclamation and then he let go, prepared to defend
himself against recapture.</p>

<p>The fall was longer than he anticipated, for
there was a depression at the back of the cabin.
He toppled in a heap, and before he could
straighten up, he saw some one rushing toward him.
Then around the corner of a shack came two figures,
one carrying a lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; they cried together.</p>

<p>Tom was aware that the dark figure which he
had seen underneath the window was jumping toward
him. The light of the lantern shone full on
Tom&rsquo;s face. He was in the act of struggling to
his feet when he felt some one kick him in the side,
and as the toe of a heavy shoe came against his
right elbow with crushing force the pain made Tom
cry out.</p>

<p>The lantern swung in a circle and by the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of it Tom, glancing up, saw Langridge standing
over him. It was he who had administered the
kick. Then the light appeared to fade away, and
Tom felt a strangely dizzy feeling. He seemed to
be sinking into a bottomless pit.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<h3>ANTICIPATIONS</h3>


<p>Tom became dimly aware that he was climbing
up from some great depth. It was hard work, and
he felt as if he was lifting the whole world on his
shoulders. No, it was all on one arm&mdash;his right&mdash;and
the pain of it made him wince.</p>

<p>Then he realized that some one was calling him,
shaking him, and he felt as if he had tumbled,
head first, into some snow drift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Tom! Are you all right, old man?
What happened? Here, swallow some more
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. He saw in the darkness
some one bending over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the&mdash;where am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and
he was again seized with a feeling of weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, old chap,&rdquo; he heard some one
saying. &ldquo;You had a bad fall, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me, Clinton. They tried to put me
in there, but I fought &rsquo;em, and then there came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
yell for help for the sophs who were bringing up a
lot of our fellows, and the ones who had me and
those on guard cut for it. I guess our lads got
away. I heard a row back here and came to see
what it was. Are you all right now? Can you
walk? If you can, we&rsquo;ll go on to the dinner.
We&rsquo;ve beaten out the sophs. Can you manage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; replied Tom, who was feeling
stronger every moment. If only that terrible pain
in his arm would cease. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Langridge?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge? He isn&rsquo;t around. I haven&rsquo;t seen
him to-night at all,&rdquo; answered Clinton. &ldquo;Feeling
better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m all right. Only my arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it broken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, only bruised. Some one kicked&mdash;I guess I
must have fallen on it,&rdquo; Tom corrected himself
quickly. His mind was in a tumult over what had
happened. He had seen Langridge plainly in the
light of a lantern carried by one of the sophomores,
and he felt that Langridge must have seen him,
for the gleam struck full on his face. Yet why had
the &rsquo;varsity pitcher attacked Tom? Could he have
mistaken him for a sophomore? Tom hardly
thought so, yet the kick had been a savage one.
His arm was swelling from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure they didn&rsquo;t catch Langridge?&rdquo;
asked Tom as he stumbled on beside Phil.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. He said he wasn&rsquo;t going to the dinner at
all. Had a date in town with some girl, I believe.&rdquo;
Tom winced, not altogether with pain. &ldquo;Why are
you so anxious about Langridge?&rdquo; went on Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, only&mdash;only I thought I saw him
around the shack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have been mistaken. You and I were the
only ones they managed to get this far, and they
wouldn&rsquo;t have had me, only about a dozen of them
tackled me at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they did to me,&rdquo; admitted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our fellows made a mistake,&rdquo; declared Phil.
&ldquo;We should have been more foxy. However, I
think we all got away. The last bunch the sophs
tackled were too much for them, and they had to
call for help. That&rsquo;s why those at the shack left
it. But come on, we&rsquo;ll get to Haddonfield. It
isn&rsquo;t very late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom did not feel much like going to a dinner,
but he repressed his disinclination and bit his lips
to keep back little exclamations of pain.</p>

<p>Phil and Tom, eluding the sophomores who
prowled about in scattered parties, found most of
their chums gathered in the hall where the spread
was arranged. They were greeted with cheers on
their entrance and made to tell their adventures,
but Tom did not mention Langridge. He explained
his injured arm by saying he had twisted it
in his fall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope it doesn&rsquo;t knock you out from pitching,
old man,&rdquo; spoke Sid sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would if I had a chance to pitch,&rdquo; responded
Tom, &ldquo;but, as it is, I guess it isn&rsquo;t going to make
much difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several other freshmen who had been caught by
the sophomores, but who managed to escape, came
straggling in, filled with excitement, and the dinner
was soon under way, with many a toast imbibed in
cider, ginger ale or water, to the confusion of the
sophomores and the success of the freshmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We fooled &rsquo;em good and proper!&rdquo; cried Sid,
who had been elected toastmaster. &ldquo;We put &rsquo;em to
rout, and now let us eat, drink and make a big
noise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which they proceeded to do, undisturbed by any
further attack of their traditional enemies.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s arm pained him so before the dinner was
over that he whispered to Phil that he was going
to leave. The big center fielder agreed to accompany
Tom back to college, and without saying anything
to the others to break up the fun, they slipped
quietly away. Dr. Marshall, of the faculty, who
was a physician as well as an instructor in physics
and chemistry, looked critically at Tom&rsquo;s arm when
Phil insisted that his chum get medical aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you got that in a fall?&rdquo; asked Dr.
Marshall, examining Tom&rsquo;s elbow, which was red
and much swollen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In a sort of a fall&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! It was a queer fall that caused that,&rdquo;
said the physician. &ldquo;More like a blow or a kick, I
should say. You haven&rsquo;t been trying to ride a
horse, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha&mdash;hum!&rdquo; ejaculated the doctor, but he
asked no more questions, for he had been a college
lad in his day and he knew the ethics of such matters.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t play ball for a couple of weeks,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll have to carry that arm in a
sling part of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I pitch on the scrub?&rdquo; asked Tom in dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want to have an operation
later,&rdquo; replied Dr. Marshall grimly.</p>

<p>Tom sighed, but said no more.</p>

<p>Healthy blood in healthy bodies has a marvelous
way of recuperating one from injuries, and in a
little over a week Tom&rsquo;s arm was so much improved
that the doctor allowed him to dispense
with the sling. In the middle of the second week
Tom started in on light practice at pitching, his
place meanwhile on the scrub having been filled by
another player.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now go slow, young man,&rdquo; advised Dr. Marshall
as Tom one day sought and obtained permission
to take part in a game against the &rsquo;varsity
nine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only human, you know, but&rdquo;&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
added to himself as Tom hurried away&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re
like a young colt. A fine physique! I wish I were
young again,&rdquo; and the good doctor sighed for the
lost days of his youth.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Tom had said nothing to
Langridge. He reasoned it all out&mdash;that the &rsquo;varsity
pitcher might have been captured as he was,
and, in breaking loose, he might have mistaken
Tom for one of the sophomores. Nor did Tom
communicate in any way his suspicions to his chums.
He knew if he began asking questions intended to
disclose whether or not Langridge had been among
those captured some one would want to know his
object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might be mistaken,&rdquo; thought Tom, and he
honestly hoped that he was. &ldquo;Anyhow, my arm is
better, and I can pitch&mdash;at least on the scrub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The game between the first and second teams
that day was a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; one. Langridge seemed to
have recovered mastery of himself and he pitched
surprisingly well. Tom, because of his hurt, was
not at his best. The &rsquo;varsity lads were joyful when
they beat the scrub by a big score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, if we do as well as that Saturday
against Boxer Hall,&rdquo; said Kindlings Woodhouse,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be all to the pepper hash, poetically speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do a great deal better than this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
against Boxer,&rdquo; declared Coach Lighton with a
shake of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because much depends on this game. I don&rsquo;t
know whether you boys have figured it out, but we
have a mighty slim chance for the pennant this
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have we any?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the coach, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s just this. If
we win the game against Boxer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which we will,&rdquo; declared Langridge confidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we do,&rdquo; went on Mr. Lighton, &ldquo;and also
win the one the following Saturday from Fairview,
we will capture the pennant by a narrow margin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Kindlings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; admonished Mr. Lighton. &ldquo;You
boys will have to play ball as you never played it
before and against rather heavy odds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, both games are away from your own
grounds. You are to play Boxer Hall on their diamond
and the Fairview game takes place over at
the co-ed institution. That means that they&rsquo;ll
have a big crowd of rooters out, and you know
what an incentive that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a lot too!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll organize a cheering club,&rdquo; added
Bricktop Molloy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And bring megaphones,&rdquo; declared Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And phonographs,&rdquo; echoed his twin brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Win the games, that&rsquo;s what you want to do!&rdquo;
said Mr. Lighton. &ldquo;Win the games! Play ball!
Bat your best, you hard hitters. You that aren&rsquo;t
so sure, practice. Fielders, get on to every fly as if
you had glue on your gloves. Kerr, play close up
to the bat. Henderson, you want to practice jumping
for high ones, for they do come high when the
boys get excited. Langridge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what about me?&rdquo; drawled the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitch your very best,&rdquo; said Mr. Lighton, and
there was a different meaning in his admonition
than before. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t let any chance go by
without practice,&rdquo; he added as he turned toward
the other members of the nine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our
work cut out for us. I want to see Randall win the
pennant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do we!&rdquo; shouted the others in a chorus as
the coach left them.</p>

<p>And the days that followed were filled with anxiety
and anticipation for the members of the nine
and those substitutes who hoped for a chance to
play. As for Tom Parsons, he felt that if he could
pitch in one of the games he would ask for nothing
more. But he had small hopes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

<h3>A GREAT GAME</h3>


<p>Sid Henderson fairly burst into the room
where Tom Parsons was studying. The first baseman
strode over to the window, looked out as
though he was glaring at some attacking force and
then throwing himself into a chair, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rotten, that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Tom, looking up from his book.
&ldquo;Has Pitchfork been at you again about the
Latin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, this is worse. I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re going
to win the game to-morrow. And if we lose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom, for he
had seldom seen his chum so excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter enough. Langridge is pitching fierce
ball. We just had some light work and arranged
a code of signals for him and Kerr. Why, you&rsquo;d
think our pitcher didn&rsquo;t have to practice! He
seemed to think that all he had to do was to stand
up in front of the Boxer players and they&rsquo;d strike
out just to please him. It makes me sick! But
that&rsquo;s not the worst of it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is?&rdquo; asked Tom, smiling at Sid&rsquo;s
vehemence. &ldquo;Might as well get it out of your system
and you&rsquo;ll feel better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what it is as well as I do,&rdquo; went
on Sid. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use trying to ignore it any
longer. I&rsquo;ve tried to fight shy of it and so have
some of the other fellows, but what&rsquo;s the use? It&rsquo;s
enough to make a fellow disgusted so he&rsquo;ll never
play on the nine again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean that Langridge isn&rsquo;t playing fair. He
doesn&rsquo;t train. He&rsquo;s been drinking and smoking on
the sly and staying up nights gambling. There&rsquo;s
no use mincing words now. I caught him drinking
in his dressing-room to-day, and he was in a blue
funk for fear I&rsquo;d tell. Said he had a weak heart
and the doctor had told him to take it. Weak
heart! Rats! He drinks because he likes it. I
tell you if we don&rsquo;t look out, we&rsquo;ll be the laughing
stock of the Tonoka Lake League. Langridge can
put himself on edge with a drink of that vile stuff
and do good work for one or two innings, maybe.
Then he&rsquo;ll go all to pieces and where will we be?
I know. We&rsquo;ll be tailenders, and it will be his
fault. It&rsquo;s a shame! Some one ought to tell
Lighton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Tom quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know I can&rsquo;t. No one could go peach
like that.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. I asked you about it once when I discovered
what ailed Langridge. You remember
what you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I almost wish I&rsquo;d told you to go and
tell. The team would be better off now, even if it
was against tradition and ethics and all that rot.
It makes me sick! Here we are to go up against
a hard proposition to-morrow and every other fellow
on the team is as fit as a fiddle except Langridge.
He seems to think it&rsquo;s a joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do the other fellows say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they don&rsquo;t know as much about him as
you and I do. But they are grumbling because
Langridge doesn&rsquo;t put enough ginger into his
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Mr. Lighton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes I think he suspects
and then again I&rsquo;m not sure. If he really knew
what Langridge was doing, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d let
him pitch. But you know Langridge has plenty of
money and he hasn&rsquo;t any one like a father or
mother to keep tabs on him, so he does as he
pleases. He&rsquo;s practically supported the team this
year, for we haven&rsquo;t made much money. I suppose
that&rsquo;s why Kindlings stands for him as he does.
Maybe that&rsquo;s why Mr. Lighton doesn&rsquo;t send him
to the bench. Langridge&rsquo;s money will do a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t like to think that because of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
he is kept on the team when there&rsquo;s a chance of our
losing the pennant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither would I. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong about the
coach, but what&rsquo;s the use of saying anything?
Langridge will pitch for us against Boxer Hall, and&mdash;no,
I&rsquo;ll not say what I was going to. I believe if
we lose that game there&rsquo;ll be such a howl that he
won&rsquo;t dare pitch against Fairview. That will give
you a chance, Tom, for the last game of the
season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Evert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s practically out of it. He hasn&rsquo;t had
any practice to speak of and wouldn&rsquo;t last two minutes.
You&rsquo;re in good trim. You did some great
work on the scrub yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s not likely to amount to anything.
However, I&rsquo;m going along and root for you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll need all the support we can get. I
declare I&rsquo;m as nervous as a girl, and I&rsquo;ve got to
buckle down and prepare for a Latin exam, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you let it go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too risky. I&rsquo;m only on the team now
by the epidermis of my molars, as the poet says. If
I flunk in Latin it will mean that I can&rsquo;t play
against Fairview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t flunk, for the team needs you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It needs more than me, but I&rsquo;m going to try
and forget it now and bone away.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom hoped to have the pleasure of taking Miss
Tyler to the game with Boxer Hall, which was to
take place on the grounds of that institution, but
the girl sent back a regretful little note, saying she
had arranged to go with Langridge or, at least, he
was to bring her home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;I thought she
was done with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, somehow, there was a rather bitter feeling
in his heart as he prepared to accompany the other
fellows to the great game that Saturday afternoon.
He almost made up his mind that he would not
bother to speak to Miss Tyler again and then he
thought such a course would be silly and he tried to
be more philosophical about it, though it was difficult.</p>

<p>Never had there been such a crowd out to witness
a game on the Boxer diamond. The grandstand
was packed long before the teams trotted out for
practice and the bleachers were overflowing. A
fringe of spectators packed the side lines, and what
with the yelling and cheering of the rival factions,
the waving of the colors, the tooting of the auto
horns in the throng of machines that had brought
parties to the contest, there was an air of excitement
that might have excused even more veteran
players from getting nervous, for the game meant
much to both colleges. If Boxer won, it would
have a chance to play Fairview for the championship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
but if Randall won the privilege would fall to
that college. And that both teams had determined
to win goes without saying.</p>

<p>Almost at the last minute Coach Lighton had
told Tom to get ready to go as a substitute, and it
was in his field uniform then instead of his ordinary
clothes that Tom went to the game. But he
had slender hopes of pitching, for Langridge
seemed in unusually fine form and that morning
at Randall had done some good work. But the
orders of the coach could not be disobeyed. So
Tom took his place on the bench with the other
Randall lads, and, after some practice on the field,
his eyes roved over the grandstand in search of a
certain face. He fancied he saw where Miss Tyler
sat, but he could not be sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge will probably go home with her,&rdquo;
thought Tom. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t bring her here, for he
came in with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had little more time for thought, however,
as the umpire was getting the new ball from the
foil cover and was about to call the game.</p>

<p>Boxer had won the toss and elected to bat last,
so it was the turn of the visitors to get up first and
show what they could do. Langridge was greeted
with a cheer from a crowd in the Randall section
of the grandstand as he went to the bat. He was
popular with the large mass of students in spite of
his ways. He seemed in good form and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a confident air about him as he swung his willow
stock to and fro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; called the umpire.</p>

<p>Dave Ogden, with a calculating glance at the
batsman, tied himself into rather a complicated
knot and threw the horsehide. It was right over
the plate and Langridge struck viciously at it, but
made a clean miss. There was a groan from the
Randall supporters and the team looked glum.
Langridge, however, was not disconcerted. He
was as confident as ever. Once more the ball was
hurled toward him. He stepped right up to it, for
he knew a pitcher&rsquo;s tricks and there was a resonant
crack that made the hearts of his chums leap. He
had lined out a &ldquo;beaut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on! go on!&rdquo; yelled Coach Lighton.
&ldquo;Leg it, Langridge, leg it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge was running low and well. The
Boxer right fielder had muffed the ball, but made
a quick recovery and threw to first. It seemed that
Langridge was safe, but the umpire, who had run
down toward the bag, called him out.</p>

<p>A groan went up from the Randall sympathizers
and the team joined in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; cried Captain Woodhouse sharply
to his men. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dispute any decisions. Leave
that to me. We&rsquo;ll accept it. You&rsquo;re up, Kerr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kerr was a notoriously good hitter and Ogden
gave him his walking papers. Sid Henderson was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
next at the bat and he knocked a little pop fly,
which the second baseman neatly caught, and Sid,
shaking his head over his hard luck, went to the
bench.</p>

<p>Captain Woodhouse himself was next to try, and
there was a grim look on his face as he went into
the box. It was justified, for he made a safe hit
and went to second on a swift grounder that Dutch
Housenlager knocked, the ball rolling between the
shortstop&rsquo;s fingers. The Randalls would have
scored if Bricktop Molloy had hit harder or higher,
but the shortstop made as pretty a catch as was seen
on the grounds that day, leaping high for the ball,
and with Bricktop out it was all over, and a goose
egg went up on the scoreboard as the result of the
first half of the initial inning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Langridge, don&rsquo;t let them get any hits
off you,&rdquo; implored Kindlings as he and his men
went to the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; promised the pitcher easily.</p>

<p>His first ball was wild and there was an anxious
feeling in the hearts of his chums. But he steadied
almost at once and his next two deliveries were
called strikes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you fan!&rdquo; he called to Pinky
Davenport, who was up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I? Watch me,&rdquo; replied Pinky, but he
only hit the wind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; called a shrill voice
from the grandstand. &ldquo;Fine, Langridge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, don&rsquo;t tell us what your uncle said,&rdquo;
retorted the pitcher. &ldquo;Keep that back, Fenton,&rdquo;
for it was the boy with the ever-present relative
who had yelled, and there was laughter at the
pitcher&rsquo;s jibe.</p>

<p>Langridge had never done better work than in
that first inning when, after passing the hardest
hitter of the Boxers to first purposely, in order to
make sure of one of their weakest stick-wielders,
the Randall twirler struck him neatly out, and the
rivals of Randall were rewarded with a neat little
white circle.</p>

<p>In the next inning Jerry Jackson was first up and
he ingloriously fanned, but Phil Clinton earned
fame for himself in the annals of his <i>alma mater</i>
by bringing in a home run&mdash;the only one of the
game. Langridge kept up his phenomenal work
and another pale zero went up for Boxer, while
Randall had a single mark that loomed big before
the eyes of the cheering throng.</p>

<p>But the hopes of those who wanted to see Randall
win suffered a severe setback, for in the next
two innings they could not score, while in each
frame for the Boxers there were two runs chalked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four to one,&rdquo; remarked Tom to Phil Clinton.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re crawling up. I wonder if we have any
show?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The game is young yet,&rdquo; answered Phil. &ldquo;I
think we will do them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Randall got one run in the fifth and Langridge
was the lucky player who brought it in. He showed
his elation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em on the run!&rdquo; he cried, and
then he went into the dressing-room. There was a
queer look on Tom&rsquo;s face as his eyes sought those
of Sid, and the latter shook his head. Coach
Lighton, too, seemed anxious. He watched for
the reappearance of Langridge, but his attention
was occupied for a moment when Woodhouse
knocked a neat fly. The captain was steaming
away for first, but the ball was also on its way
there and both arrived about the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; cried the umpire, and a dispute at once
arose. The Randalls had to give in, though it was
manifestly unfair. When Langridge came out of
the dressing-room there was a noticeable change in
his manner. His breath smelled of cloves, and
Sid, who noticed it, made a despairing gesture. A
little later Housenlager hit the breeze strongly
and went out, the score at the ending of the fifth
inning being 4 to 2 in favor of the Boxer team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Langridge,&rdquo; said the coach earnestly, &ldquo;it
depends on you. If you can hold them down, we
are pretty sure of winning, even if we have to go
ten innings, for some of our batters have Ogden&rsquo;s
measure.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; cried Langridge. &ldquo;You watch
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he failed miserably. He did manage to
strike out two men, for there was snap and vicious
vim in the way he delivered the balls, but suddenly,
when the influence of the stimulant he had taken
wore off, he went to pieces and the Boxers piled in
five runs before they were stopped by a remarkable
brace in the Randall fielding contingent.</p>

<p>There was a steely look in the eyes of Coach
Lighton as the Randalls came in for their turn to
bat in the sixth inning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better next time,&rdquo; promised Langridge,
but he spoke rather languidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; exclaimed the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; and the pitcher seemed suddenly
awakened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re not going to pitch next inning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m manager of this team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the coach. I say you shan&rsquo;t pitch any
more in this game, or, if you do, I&rsquo;ll resign here and
now. Captain Woodhouse, are you with me in
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, can&rsquo;t you take a rest for a couple of
innings, Fred, and pitch the last one?&rdquo; asked the
captain, adding: &ldquo;if the Boxers will allow us to
suspend the rules for you.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I pitch at all, I&rsquo;ll pitch the whole game!&rdquo;
cried Langridge fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do I resign,&rdquo; was the decision of Mr.
Lighton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; said Woodhouse with a
shrug of his shoulders, as if ridding himself of the
burden. &ldquo;Whatever you say goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then I say Langridge goes to the
bench. He&rsquo;s not fit to pitch and he knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me?&rdquo; demanded the
youth haughtily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to tell?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lighton
quickly, with a sharp look.</p>

<p>Langridge, without a word, walked into the
dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parsons will pitch the remainder of the game,&rdquo;
went on the coach to the Randall players and he
made the necessary announcement to the game officials.
&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;come on; you&rsquo;re up in
place of Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Parsons&rsquo; heart gave a great throb. At last
he had the chance for which he had waited so long.
He was to pitch in a big game!</p>

<p>Tom was a good batter. He was also acquainted
with many pitchers&rsquo; tricks, for Mr. Lighton had
given him good instruction. Tom was ready for
whatever came. The first ball Ogden delivered
was an incurve. Tom instinctively stepped back to
avoid it, but it went neatly over the plate and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
strike was called on him. He shut his teeth hard.
He reasoned that Ogden would expect him to be on
the lookout the second time for an outcurve, for
it might naturally be supposed that the pitcher
would vary his delivery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he thinks I&rsquo;m looking for an out,&rdquo; thought
Tom. &ldquo;Therefore he&rsquo;ll give me another in. I&rsquo;ll
be ready for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was. He stepped right into the next ball,
which was an incurve, and with a mighty sweep
sent it sailing far over the right fielder&rsquo;s head. It
was good for three bases and Tom took them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! Keep running! That&rsquo;s a beaut! Take
another! Make it a homer!&rdquo; yelled the crowd,
which was on its feet shouting like mad, waving
hats, hands, handkerchiefs and college colors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay there!&rdquo; cautioned Coach Lighton, for the
ball was being relayed home.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s sensational hit seemed to put new life into
the team and Bricktop Molloy also brought in a
run. That, however, ended the good work.</p>

<p>Then came Tom&rsquo;s turn in the box. That he was
a little nervous was natural, but he kept control of
himself and only allowed one hit, though it was
good eventually for a run. There was a noticeable
stiffening in the work of the team and the coach
congratulated Tom as he came in with his chums
to take their turn at the bat again.</p>

<p>The seventh inning saw four runs safely laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
away for Randall, while the marker put up a neat
little ring in the square for Boxer, for Tom struck
out two of the three men who were up, one going
out on a pop fly, the pitcher having misjudged his
batter. Neither side scored in the eighth, and
when Randall got three runs in the ninth, and, in
spite of strenuous work on the part of Tom, the
Boxers got one run that same inning, the score
was tied&mdash;11 to 11.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten innings! They&rsquo;ve got to play ten innings!&rdquo;
went the cry around the field. Then came
more cheers. It was a game of games and it
began to look as if the hoodoo against Randall was
broken and that the college had a chance for the
pennant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Tom Parsons!&rdquo; yelled Ford
Fenton, and what a shout there was!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would your uncle think of him?&rdquo; asked
a student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d say he was all right!&rdquo; rejoined Ford
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Randall got one run in the tenth, putting them
ahead, and then came a supreme struggle for Tom.
Coolly and calculatingly he delivered the balls.
He struck out the first man, who viciously threw
down his bat so hard that it splintered. The second
man also went the same way, and there was a
salvo of cheers that shook the stands, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
stamping of feet of the anxious ones threatened to
bring down the structures.</p>

<p>Tom measured his next man and sent in a neat
little drop. But the batter was a veteran and got
under it in time. He sent it well out into the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it, Jerry! Take it!&rdquo; cried the coach, for
the horsehide seemed about to fall into the right
fielder&rsquo;s hands. But he muffed it, and what a
howl there was! George Stoddard, who had
knocked it, kept on to second, for which he had to
slide, but he was called safe. Then Tom was
obliged to pass the next man to first, for he was an
excellent hitter, while the one who followed him
was not. But just then one of those &ldquo;accidents&rdquo;
that are always cropping up in sport happened and
the poor hitter made good, knocking a curious little
twisting fly that the first baseman misjudged, and
the run came in, again tieing the score. But no
more Boxer players crossed home plate.</p>

<p>It was with a &ldquo;do or die&rdquo; expression on all the
faces of the Randalls that they came to bat in the
eleventh inning. The story of that game is college
history now, and how Tom brought in a run
after a magnificent hit that would have been a
&ldquo;homer&rdquo; but for the fleetness of the opposing
center fielder&rsquo;s feet is told to many a freshman.
They could do no more, though, after getting one
ahead.</p>

<p>It needed but a single run on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Boxers to tie the score and two to win. But Tom
resolved that they should not get even that one
tally. He went to his box, his teeth clenched, making
his jaw look firm and square. He resolved to
try a new sort of twisting curve that he had used
several times against the &rsquo;varsity. Each time it
had proved deceptive. He worked it on the first
man and sent him ingloriously to the bench. Then
the second batter fell for it, but Tom dared not
try it on the third. He felt himself getting nervous,
and his next delivery was a bit wild. A ball
was called on him, but that was all. The next
three deliveries were strikes, and <a href="#image04">the batter</a>, though
he fanned desperately at them, <a href="#image04">missed each time</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">

<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_270">THE BATTER MISSED EACH TIME</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton as Tom,
with a wildly throbbing heart, walked out of the
box, while a hush fell over the assemblage, for the
crowd could hardly realize that the game was
over and that Randall had won by a score of 13
to 12.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, Parsons! Oh, pretty work!&rdquo;
yelled a host of supporters, and then such cheering
as there was!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, fellows, a cheer for Boxer Hall!&rdquo; cried
Captain Woodhouse, and it was given, followed by
the college yell.</p>

<p>Boxer generously retaliated, and as the teams
ran for the dressing-rooms Langridge, pale and
with trembling hands, stepped out. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
dressed in his street garments, and without a word
to his chums, he started across the diamond for
the grandstand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going over to her,&rdquo; thought Tom, and
the joy of the victory he had helped to win was
embittered for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parsons, you did splendidly!&rdquo; cried Mr. Lighton.
&ldquo;I congratulate you with all my heart. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for you, we&rsquo;d have lost the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we would. You&rsquo;re the regular pitcher on
this team for the remainder of the season, subject,
of course, to the confirmation of Captain Woodhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say,&rdquo; assented Kindlings, but
he looked a bit uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only two more games,&rdquo; went on the
coach, &ldquo;one out of town next Saturday, and then
comes the final struggle with Fairview. If we win
that, we&rsquo;ll have the pennant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross. &ldquo;Look
who&rsquo;s going to pitch for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; replied Tom with a
laugh, but he was silenced with cheers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I want you to win that game,&rdquo; concluded
the coach as he walked off the diamond and the
team got ready to go back to Randall.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

<h3>LANGRIDGE APPEALS</h3>


<p>While the stage coach in which the players had
come from Randall was being gotten ready to take
the victorious nine back Tom strolled across the
diamond toward the grandstand. He wanted to
be alone for a moment and think, for he had many
ideas in his mind, and they were not all connected
with his recent work in the pitcher&rsquo;s box. A certain
bright-eyed girl figured largely in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought she&rsquo;d given him up,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Well, of course, it&rsquo;s none of my affair,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There generally was a &ldquo;but,&rdquo; Tom felt. The
crowd was nearly gone and he was about to turn
back and join his chums.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of a girlish figure
alone in the big stand. He looked to make sure
who it was, for at the first glimpse he had felt that
it was she of whom he was thinking. As he did so
the girl looked at him. It was Miss Tyler, and
Tom noticed that there were tears in her eyes. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
saw nothing of Langridge as he hastened toward
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Madge&mdash;Miss Tyler!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;what is the matter? Have you lost anything?
Are you alone? I thought Fred Langridge was
going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stamped her little foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak his name to me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom opened his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came over to me in&mdash;in no proper condition
to escort me home,&rdquo; she went on tearfully.
&ldquo;Oh, Tom, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m so miserable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She acted as though she were going to break
down and cry in real earnest, and Tom was on the
anxious edge, for he hated to see girls weep. But
she mastered herself with an effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I take you back to Haddonfield?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and she came down from the
upper part of the stand to join him. They walked
off the field, both silent for a time, and Tom was
wondering what would be the safest subject to talk
about. But Miss Tyler spoke first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did fine work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad
you got the chance to pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; declared Tom, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He did not know whether or not to
mention his rival&rsquo;s name. But she understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I&mdash;I&rsquo;m very sorry for him. It&rsquo;s all his
horrid money that&rsquo;s doing it. He wants to be
what the boys call a &lsquo;sport.&rsquo; But he isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s
unfair to himself&mdash;to me. But I&rsquo;m done with him!
I shall never speak to him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was both glad and sorry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you will win from Fairview?&rdquo;
asked the girl after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you do. I want to see that game, but I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me take you?&rdquo; asked Tom
quickly. &ldquo;We are going in a number of autos and
there&rsquo;ll be lots of room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean to hint so broadly,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
and her face crimsoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask you, anyhow,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And help me to pitch to win,&rdquo; added Tom, and
he tried to look into her face, but she averted her
eyes.</p>

<p>There was great celebrating in Randall that
night. Some of the boys wanted to light historic
bonfires along the river, which blazes were always
kindled on great occasions, but Mr. Lighton reminded
the lads that they had still to win the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with Fairview before they would be champions,
and he urged that the game was no easy one. So
milder forms of making glad were substituted.
Tom was the hero of the hour, and he felt that
there had been made up to him everything that he
had suffered in being kept so long on the scrub.</p>

<p>It was dark in the apartments of Langridge.
No one had seen him since the game and few cared
about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got just what was coming to him,&rdquo; declared
Sid vindictively. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have thrown the game for
a drink of liquor and a cigarette. Pah! I&rsquo;ve no
use for such a chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe he didn&rsquo;t mean to do it,&rdquo; replied
Tom, who could afford to be generous. &ldquo;He may
have taken some to steady his nerves and it went
to his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats! It ought to have gone to his pitching
arm. But I&rsquo;ve got to bone away. Exams are getting
nearer and nearer every day, and the closer
they come the less I seem to know about Latin.
From now on I&rsquo;m going to think, eat, sleep and
dream in Latin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following Saturday the team went to the
Indian school at Carlisle and played a game with
the red men. It was a hard-fought battle and the
aborigines made the mistake of putting in a lot of
substitutes for the first few innings, for they had a
poor opinion of Randall. But the visitors rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
up a good score and Tom was a whirlwind at pitching,
holding the red men down to a low score.
Then the Indians awakened and sent in some of
their best players, but the Randalls had the game
&ldquo;in the refrigerator,&rdquo; as Holly Cross said, and took
it home with them, despite the war cries of the
redskins and their efforts to annex the scalp-locks
of the palefaces.</p>

<p>The winning of this game against what was
generally considered to be a much stronger team
than that of Randall did much to infuse an aggressive
spirit into the latter players. The trip,
too, acted as a sort of tonic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys, I think we&rsquo;re fit to make the fight of our
lives a week from to-day,&rdquo; declared Captain Woodhouse
as he and the team were on their way back
to college. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wipe the diamond up with
Fairview and then maybe that banner won&rsquo;t look
fine at the top of our flagstaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready
to play &rsquo;em now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; cried Pete Backus, giving a great
jump up into the air, seemingly to justify his title
of &ldquo;Grasshopper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ford Fenton, but
Holly Cross gave such an imitation of an Indian
war whoop that what the former coach had said
was lost &ldquo;in the shuffle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great work, old man!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Tom as he linked his arm in that of the new &rsquo;varsity
pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a fine catch of yours, to return the
compliment,&rdquo; said Tom with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go forming a mutual admiration society,&rdquo;
advised Mr. Lighton. &ldquo;Play ball&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer what&rsquo;s become of Langridge,&rdquo; remarked
Tom to Sid when they were in their room
a few nights later, talking over the approaching
final game with Fairview. &ldquo;He seems to have
dropped out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;d better stay,&rdquo; declared Sid.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never be any more account to the team.
We&rsquo;ll have a new manager when we whip Fairview.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we only do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will. I only hope I can play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, is there any chance that you won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m pretty shaky in Latin, and Pitchfork
has warned me that if I slump, it&rsquo;s me to the
bench for the rest of this term. I&rsquo;m going over
and see Bricktop Molloy. He&rsquo;s a fiend at Latin.
Rather study it than eat. He&rsquo;s been coaching me
lately, and I want to get the benefit of it. So I&rsquo;ll
just go and bone with him a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, old man. Wish I could help you,
but I&rsquo;ve got to look after my own rations. I&rsquo;m
none too safe.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid went out and Tom was left alone with his
books. But somehow he could not study. He
took no sense of the printed page. There was an
uneasiness in his mind and he could not put his
thoughts into form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m thinking
too much of baseball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up to take a turn in the corridors to
change the current of his thoughts when there came
a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he cried, thinking it would prove to
be some of his chums. The portal slowly swung
and Tom, looking at the widening crack, saw the
pale face of Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; asked the former pitcher, and
his voice trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Tom heartily. &ldquo;Where
have you been keeping yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t much matter. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come to ask
a favor of you, Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A favor of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s a mighty big one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a dogged, determined air about him
as he stood there facing his rival who had supplanted
him, and Tom wondered what was coming
next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll do anything I can for you, Langridge,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you hear what I want. There&rsquo;s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
use beating about the bush, Parsons. I&rsquo;ve been
mighty mean to you. I&rsquo;ve played a low-down
hand against you, but I&rsquo;m not going to apologize&mdash;not
now. I thought it was fair&mdash;in war, you
know. I didn&rsquo;t want you to pitch in my place, but
you&rsquo;ve done me out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I acted square,&rdquo; said Tom quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. You were white. I wasn&rsquo;t. I
didn&rsquo;t play fair about that wire nor yet about
sneaking in the dormitory that night. You did.
I suppose you know&mdash;about the night you were
captured&mdash;the night of the freshman dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you knew it was I before you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew it was you before I kicked you,&rdquo;
went on Langridge, and he spoke as if he was getting
through a disagreeable confession. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t mean to boot you so hard, though. I
thought maybe you&rsquo;d give up pitching if you got a
good crack on the arm, but you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I see. Well, you&rsquo;ve got what you wanted
and I got what I never expected. Now I want you
to do me a favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to refuse to pitch in the Fairview
game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom wondered whether he had heard aright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me to refuse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; went on Langridge eagerly. &ldquo;Tell
Kindlings&mdash;tell Lighton you can&rsquo;t pitch&mdash;that your
arm has given out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Tell them. Tell them anything,
as long as you don&rsquo;t pitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why don&rsquo;t you want me to pitch? Do you
want to see your college lose? Not because I&rsquo;m
the best pitcher that ever happened, but you know
there&rsquo;s no one else they can put in at this late day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me! I&rsquo;ll pitch. I want to pitch. I&rsquo;ve just
got to. You don&rsquo;t know what it means to me. Let
me pitch this last game. Please, Parsons! It
won&rsquo;t mean much to you and it means everything
to me. I can do it. See, I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t touched a
drop since&mdash;since the Boxer game. I&rsquo;ve been getting
in shape. I&rsquo;m as steady as a rock. I can pitch
the game of my life. Come, do! Say you won&rsquo;t
pitch. They&rsquo;ll give me a chance then. I want to
get in the last game&mdash;and win. Will you? Will
you let me get in this last game in your place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was leaning forward, his hands held out to
Tom, his rival, begging a boon of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you resign in my favor?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
know it&rsquo;s a big request, but will you, Parsons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom did not know what to answer.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

<h3>THE FINAL CONTEST</h3>


<p>Langridge stood before his rival, waiting. It
was quiet in the little room, so quiet that the ticking
of the alarm clock sounded loud. Outside
could be heard the tramp of feet in the corridor,
students going to and fro. Langridge glanced
nervously at the door. He was plainly afraid lest
some one should enter and find him there.</p>

<p>It was a hard problem for Tom to solve. The
appeal of the lad who had done much to injure him
moved him strongly. He knew what it would
mean to Langridge not to pitch&mdash;that he would be
out of athletics for the rest of his college course.
If Tom gave way in his favor, it would mean his
rehabilitation and for Tom only a temporary loss
of prestige.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you do it?&rdquo; asked Langridge softly.</p>

<p>Tom did not answer. He paced up and down
the room. What ought he to say? He felt that he
could afford to sacrifice his own interests&mdash;could
even forego the high honor of pitching in what
was the greatest game of the college year&mdash;for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sake of Langridge. If he did not and if Langridge
went away disheartened, it might mean that
he would plunge deeper into dissipation. Then
there came to Tom the thought of the nine. Was
it fair to the others, to the college?</p>

<p>Something told him it was not, that it was his
duty to pitch&mdash;to do his best&mdash;to win for the sake
of the college and the nine. Langridge might possibly
do it, but it was doubtful. The former
pitcher could not be sure of himself, sure that he
had mastered his desire for stimulant. Then Tom
decided, not on his own account but for the sake of
the team and the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, Langridge,&rdquo; he replied, and his
voice showed the anguish he felt at the pain he inflicted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll pitch?&rdquo; asked his rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feel that I must. The team depends
on me, and&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t go back on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Langridge must have seen that Tom&rsquo;s answer
was final, for without a word he turned and left
the room.</p>

<p>Then Tom felt a wave of remorse sweep over
him. After all, had he done right? Had he done
the best thing? He was almost on the point of
rushing after Langridge and telling him he could
pitch in the final game, for the memory of his
face haunted Tom. But when his hand was on
the knob of the door Sid entered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom&rsquo;s chum, looking
curiously at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you had been seeing ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have&mdash;a sort of one,&rdquo; answered Tom
with an uneasy laugh. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you make out with
the Latin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty punk, I guess. Bricktop says I&rsquo;ve got to
put in all my spare time boning. If I slump and
can&rsquo;t play that last game, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare slump!&rdquo; cried Tom earnestly.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t put a new man on first at this late day.
Don&rsquo;t you dare slump, Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll try not to,&rdquo; and Sid dumped himself
down in the easy chair and with an air of dogged
determination began devouring Latin verbs.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;varsity had had its final practice against
the scrub, with Tom in the box for the first team.
He was beginning to take it as a matter of course
and acquiring that which he needed most&mdash;confidence
in himself. The scrub pitcher who had replaced
him was good, but he was pretty well batted,
while very few hits, and these only one-baggers,
were secured off Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Lighton two days before the
game, &ldquo;I think I can see our way clear to the
Tonoka Lake League pennant. Now take it easy
to-morrow, a little light exercise, be careful of
what you eat, don&rsquo;t get nervous, go to bed early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and sleep well. Then Saturday afternoon we&rsquo;ll go
to Fairview and bring back the banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for our coach!&rdquo; called Kerr, and
Mr. Lighton, veteran that he was, blushed with
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we win,&rdquo; remarked Ford Fenton as the
team walked to the dressing-rooms. &ldquo;My uncle
says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Kerr threw his big catching mitt with such
good aim that it struck Fenton full in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;huh! ho! What&rsquo;d you do that for?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to wear out that uncle of
yours,&rdquo; was the cool answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting warm
weather now and you&rsquo;d better can him so he&rsquo;ll keep
until next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ford scowled and then laughed, for he was
good-natured in spite of his one failing.</p>

<p>Sid entered the room where Tom was late that
afternoon with a worried look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitchfork has decided to have a special Latin
exam to-morrow for my class. Wow! I was
counting on it going over, but it won&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;ve
got to take it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not well&mdash;bad. If I slump, do you know
what it means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t play against Fairview?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Oh, Tom, I&rsquo;m as nervous as a girl
before her first big party. Here, coach me a bit,&rdquo;
and Tom, taking the books, gave Sid what help he
could until they were both so tired and sleepy that
Tom insisted that bed was the only place for them.</p>

<p>The news spread the next day. Sid was the only
member of the team who was in the special Latin
class, and consequently the only one who had to
go through the ordeal. When he went into recitation
his mates on the team gathered in silent conclave
on the diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Sid slumps,&rdquo; spoke Captain Woodhouse, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; pleaded Bricktop Molloy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he does, couldn&rsquo;t we play Langridge on
first?&rdquo; suggested Phil Clinton. &ldquo;He used to practice
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge is down and out,&rdquo; declared Kerr.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over him. He won&rsquo;t
speak to me any more. I guess he knows he&rsquo;s got
to do a lot of studying to pass, and he must be
tutoring with some grind. He keeps himself
mighty scarce. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we couldn&rsquo;t use him,&rdquo; said Kindlings. &ldquo;It
all depends on Sid. I wish the exam was over.
It&rsquo;s like waiting for a jury to come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole team was on tenterhooks. No one
felt like talking, and some one would start a topic
only to witness it die a natural death. The members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of the nine paced to and fro on the diamond.
They were waiting for news from Sid. If he did
not pass he could not play, and it practically meant
a lowering of their chances for the pennant.</p>

<p>An hour went by. A few lads began coming
from the recitation room where the examination
was being held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them have finished,&rdquo; commented Tom.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask &rsquo;em how Sid&rsquo;s making out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the Latin students strolled over toward
where the ball players were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Henderson doing?&rdquo; asked Kindlings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweating like a cart horse,&rdquo; was the characteristic
answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stiff exam all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a groan in concert and the anxious
waiting was resumed. Fifteen minutes passed.
Several more students had come from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can he be?&rdquo; murmured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he comes!&rdquo; cried Phil Clinton as Sid
appeared, coming slowly toward the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he failed,&rdquo; said Kindlings solemnly.
Certainly in Sid&rsquo;s approach there was not the air
of a conqueror.</p>

<p>All at once he stopped, bent down to the ground
and appeared to be tearing something to pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see,&rdquo; proposed Kerr.</p>

<p>They advanced and beheld a curious sight. Sid
was tearing up a book and making a little heap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the leaves. A moment later he touched a match to
the pile, and the paper began to burn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing?&rdquo; called Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you pass?&rdquo; fairly roared Kindlings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Sid as calmly as if he had always
expected to. &ldquo;I passed with honors, and now I&rsquo;m
destroying the evidence. I&rsquo;m applying the torch
to Csar&rsquo;s Commentaries and I&rsquo;ll never open a
book like it again in my life. Come on, fellows,
join the festive throng. Tra la la! Merrily do
we sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began prancing about and the others, with
yells of joy, joined in. Sid would cover first base
for them in the big game.</p>

<p>With a tooting of auto horns, the waving of
many flags, shouts, cheers, yells of encouragement,
laughter from many pretty girls, the waving of
handkerchiefs, renditions of the college yell the
ball nine and its supporters started the next day in
a long cavalcade for Fairview.</p>

<p>Several automobiles had been provided for the
use of the team, and in one of these rode Tom and
Miss Tyler, whom he had called for at her home
that morning. A number of ladies went along as
chaperones for the girls of Haddonfield.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill and most of the faculty also went
to the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming, Professor Tines?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the head of the college as he and the other instructors
were about to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care much for baseball. I shall
remain here and arrange for another Latin examination
for some of the students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid groaned and his chums laughed, whereat
Professor Tines frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll win?&rdquo; asked Miss Tyler
as she sat next to Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; he answered promptly.</p>

<p>When the Randall team and its supporters arrived
they found a big throng present to greet
them. Even their opponents sent out a ringing
cheer of welcome. The Fairview nine was out on
the diamond practicing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snappy work,&rdquo; observed Tom critically as the
batting and catching was under way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can do just as good,&rdquo; asserted Kindlings.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get nervous now. You&rsquo;ve got to
pitch your head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one started the Randall college song, &ldquo;<i>Aut
vincere aut mori</i>,&rdquo; and as the beautiful strains
floated over the diamond when the players poured
out from the dressing-rooms the team came to a
sudden halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, fellows,&rdquo; said Kindlings solemnly,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Either we conquer or we die!&rsquo; Play for all that&rsquo;s
in you and then some more,&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>Auto horns tooted blatantly, girls cried in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
clear, shrill voices, the lady contingent of Fairview
rendering some weird yells. Then there were the
hoarse voices of the boys, to which answered the
cheers of Randall. The grandstand and bleachers
were waving geometrical figures of brilliant hues.
It was an inspiring sight. No wonder that the
players felt nerved to do their best, for on the result
of the game depended much.</p>

<p>Kindlings missed the call when the coin was
spun, and he and his men had to start the hitting.
But they did not mind this, and when, in the revised
batting order, Kerr went up first, he &ldquo;poked
his stick into the horsehide for a two-bagger,&rdquo; as
Holly Cross said. There was a yell that could
have been heard a mile and every Randall lad was
on his feet shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on! go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Kerr stopped at second prudently, for he
would have been nabbed at third. This opened the
game and the play at once became hot. Randall
scored two runs that inning and Tom, giving walking
papers to a particularly heavy hitter, managed
to come out of the initial ordeal without a hit
being registered against him.</p>

<p>The Randall boys went wild then and began the
song, &ldquo;When Fairview awoke from her sweet
dream of peace,&rdquo; which was repeated again and
again.</p>

<p>But the next three innings saw only the negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
sign chalked up in the frame on the scoreboard
given over to Randall, while in the last half
of the fourth Fairview secured a run, for one of
the players &ldquo;got the Indian sign&rdquo; on Tom, to quote
Holly Cross, who was an expert in diamond slang,
and &ldquo;bit his initials in the spheroid for a three-bagger.&rdquo;
The run would not have been scored,
for there were two men out, only Joe Jackson made
what seemed to be an inexcusable fumble, and the
runner came in. Still it looked safe for Randall
until the fatal seventh inning.</p>

<p>For some teams this is held to be a lucky one,
but it was not for Randall. Tom was doing his
best, but in delivering one ball he gave his arm a
peculiar wrench, and a sharp twinge of pain in the
region where Langridge had kicked him made him
wince. After that he could not control his curves
so well, and three men made safeties off him, a
trio of runs being registered. The score was 4 to
2 in favor of Fairview at the close of the seventh.
Kindlings looked grave and Coach Lighton paced
nervously to and fro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old man?&rdquo; the captain
asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I gave my
arm a little twist, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come inside and we&rsquo;ll massage it,&rdquo; proposed
Mr. Lighton, who was always ready for emergencies,
and he and Kindlings rubbed some liniment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
on Tom&rsquo;s joint. It felt a little better, and Tom
said so, though when he went into the box, following
an inning when Bricktop Molloy brought in
one run, the pitcher was in considerable misery.
He shut his teeth grimly, however, and resolved to
do his best, though to deliver his most effective
curves meant to give himself much pain.</p>

<p>Tom only allowed two hits and one run came
in, making the score at the ending of the eighth
inning 5 to 3 in favor of Fairview.</p>

<p>How the co-eds shouted and cheered then and
there was corresponding gloom among the Randallites
until once more that grand old song, &ldquo;<i>Aut
vincere aut mori</i>,&rdquo; welled forth and gave confidence
to an almost despairing nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about our last chance, fellows,&rdquo; said Kindlings
grimly as he walked to the bat.</p>

<p>He waited for a good ball, though two strikes
were called on him, and then, with a mighty sweep
of his strong arms, he sent the sphere away out into
the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good hit! Oh, a pretty hit!&rdquo; yelled Phil
Clinton. &ldquo;Run, old man! Run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how Kindlings could run! On and on he
leaped, around first base, speeding toward second,
while the stands were in a frenzy of excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Third! third!&rdquo; cried the coach, for the left
fielder was still after the ball.</p>

<p>Kindlings was running strong, and he had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
started home. Would he reach it? The fielder
had the ball now. With a terrific heave he sent
it to the third baseman, but Kindlings was half way
home. Then ensued a curious scene. The baseman
was afraid to throw the ball to the catcher,
for Kindlings, who was tall and was running upright,
was in the way. The baseman started to
trail the captain down. There was a race. Kindlings
looked back and decided to keep on to
home. The catcher was leaping about excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw the ball! throw the ball!&rdquo; he yelled.
But the baseman thought he could outrun Kindlings.
He almost succeeded and then, when he
saw it was too late, he tossed the ball over the
captain&rsquo;s head to the catcher. Kindlings dropped
and, amid a cloud of dust, slid home.</p>

<p>Like a flash the hand of the catcher holding the
ball shot toward him. There was a moment of
suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; howled the umpire, and one more run
went to the credit of Randall.</p>

<p>Tom brought in another not so sensational, but
it counted. He knocked a pretty fly, which sailed
over the second baseman&rsquo;s head and the pitcher
got to first, stole second and came in with a rush
on a swift grounder bunt that Phil Clinton sacrificed
on under orders.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

<h3>VICTORY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;The score is tie! the score is tie!&rdquo; came the
yells. And so it was&mdash;5 to 5 in the last half of
the ninth inning. From the Randall stand came
the chorus of the song, &ldquo;We have their measure,
we&rsquo;ll beat them at pleasure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The game, however, was far from won. There
were a bunch of heavy hitters to come to the bat,
and Tom&rsquo;s arm was in poor shape. But he said
nothing and walked to the box with a step as light
as though he knew he was to win.</p>

<p>When he gave two men their bases on balls there
was some groaning among the Randallites, but
Tom knew what he was doing. Lem Sellig and
Frank Sullivan were generally good for safeties,
and he could afford to take no chances. He had
the measure of the next three men and he took it.</p>

<p>Seldom had the devotees of the diamond witnessed
such pitching as the exhibition which Tom
gave after he had allowed the heavy hitters to
walk. No one ever knew what he suffered as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
delivered his most effective curves, but the cheering
that resulted when he had struck his third man
out, without allowing a player to get to third base,
must have warmed his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ten-inning game!&rdquo; was the cry, for the score
still stood tie. Over in the grandstand Ford Fenton,
who was cheer leader, called for the &ldquo;Brace,
brace, brace&rdquo; song and it came in a mighty chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one run! only one!&rdquo; pleaded hundreds of
Randall lads. &ldquo;One run to beat &rsquo;em, and then
Tom Parsons will strike &rsquo;em out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom heard it and smiled. His arm had been
given another rubbing, and though it pained him,
he went to the bat first in the tenth inning with a
confident step. Somewhere on the grandstand he
knew a girl was watching him, and he tried to single
her out. Could that be she standing up and
waving a yellow and maroon flag at him? He
hoped so, and he gritted his teeth, resolving to hit
the ball for all that was in him.</p>

<p>There was a steely look in the pitcher&rsquo;s eye as he
delivered a vicious ball to Tom. Tom saw it coming
and stepped up to it. He remembered a former
experience. His bat got under it and he lifted
and hit it outwardly in a long, upward curve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too high! too high! He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; murmured
Kindlings sadly, but Tom was off for first like a
deer. In some unaccountable manner the right
fielder muffed the ball and there were groans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
anguish. Tom started for second, but was warned
back. Later he did manage to &ldquo;purloin the bag
like a second-story man getting away with a diamond
necklace,&rdquo; to quote Holly Cross, and went to
third on a pop fly by Housenlager, who never got
to first. Then, on a sacrifice hit by Kerr, Tom slid
home, the dust cloud being so thick that the spectators
could not witness the play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; declared the umpire, and this meant
that a run had been added to the score for Randall,
making the tally 6 to 5 in their favor. Tom was
pale when he arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; asked Kindlings anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer, but Tom had to bite his
lips to keep back a groan of pain. He had jarred
his sore arm badly.</p>

<p>Though Randall tried desperately to better the
score, it was not to be. Their only hope now lay
in keeping their opponents from making a run, and,
if they did, they would have the game and the
championship.</p>

<p>Tom felt as if he would collapse, and his first
ball, instead of being a puzzling drop as he intended,
went straight over the plate distressingly
slow, so that Ted Puder, captain of the Fairview
team, hit it mightily. Up and up it went, a black
speck against the blue sky, while the youths and
maidens of the institute were yelling encouragingly
to the runner, who had started for first.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he only gets it! If he only can get it!&rdquo;
murmured Kindlings as he watched Phil Clinton
race after the ball.</p>

<p>It was a long, high fly, and Phil had to sprint
well toward the back field to even get under it. He
had turned and was racing with all his might.
Would he judge it properly? Could he hold it
after he got it?</p>

<p>He had turned again, and with his eye on the
ball was running backward now. He stumbled
over a stone and seemed about to fall. There was
a groan from the Randallites, but Phil recovered
himself. The ball was almost over his head when
he saw that he had not gone far enough back. It
was too late to take another step, but Phil did the
next best thing. He leaped up, and, with his right
hand extended as far as it would stretch, he caught
the ball. It was a mighty fine play and the yells
and applause that followed testified to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Runner&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; decided the umpire.</p>

<p>Tom breathed easier. His heart had been in
his throat when he saw what had happened to the
first ball he delivered. But Phil had made good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a magnificent catch!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr.
Churchill as he adjusted his glasses, that had been
knocked off in the excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted another member of the faculty
who sat near him. &ldquo;And how Clinton can run!
I&rsquo;d like to see him on the gridiron.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will,&rdquo; went on Dr. Churchill.
&ldquo;The boys will soon organize the eleven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s nerve came back to him. Now he didn&rsquo;t
mind the pain in his arm. There was one man out
and Tom&rsquo;s team was a run ahead. If he could
only strike out two more men the championship
would be safe.</p>

<p>The next batter was easy, for he was a poor hitter,
and Tom soon sent him to the bench. The
following player was one of the best stick-wielders
Fairview had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can only get him,&rdquo; thought the pitcher.</p>

<p>Warily Tom delivered to him an inshoot. It
was missed cleanly, but a look in the batter&rsquo;s eye
warned the pitcher that another such curve would
not fool him. Tom sent in a puzzling drop and
the batter struck over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two strikes!&rdquo; called the umpire, amid almost
breathless silence.</p>

<p>Kerr signaled for another incurve, but Tom
shook his head. He was going to deliver a style
of ball he had used but once before that day because
it twisted his arm fiercely. It was a sort of
&ldquo;fade-away&rdquo; ball, made famous by a great professional
player.</p>

<p>Tom drew his arm back, having gripped the ball
strongly. The action made him wince with pain,
but there was no time now to stop for that. Out
straightened his muscles and the horsehide left his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
hand swiftly. He knew it was a good ball, but in
spite of that he almost feared lest he should hear
the fatal &ldquo;ping&rdquo; as the bat hit it or listen to the
umpire&rsquo;s &ldquo;ball one.&rdquo; Tom felt that he could not
toss another curve. His arm was numb and tingled
away up to his shoulder. He saw a black wall
looming up before his eyes and there was a ringing
in his ears.</p>

<p>But above the tumult he heard a voice shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three strikes! Batter&rsquo;s out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, what yelling there was! How the handkerchiefs
and banners fluttered! How the girls&rsquo;
shrill voices mingled with the deep cheering of the
boys! What a stamping of feet on the grandstand!</p>

<p>Then out from the tumult came booming that
heart-stirring song of Randall: &ldquo;We have come
and we have conquered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom staggered as he pulled off his glove and
walked toward the bench. His mouth was parched
and dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good old man!&rdquo; yelled Kindlings, rushing
up and embracing him. &ldquo;Oh, fine! Oh, great!
Oh, oh, oh! Wow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up with him, fellows!&rdquo; called Sid Henderson.
&ldquo;On our shoulders!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; protested Tom.</p>

<p>But he might as well have talked to the wind.
They lifted him up and marched with him around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the field, singing again: &ldquo;We have come and we
have conquered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, a good round of cheers for Fairview,&rdquo;
proposed Kindlings, and the team, gathering
in a circle about Tom, who had managed to
descend to the ground, raised their voices in a
tribute to those over whom they had been victorious.</p>

<p>From where they were gathered, downcast but
not disheartened at their defeat, the Fairview team
sent back an answering cheer. Then came more
songs from the contingent of Randall students, and
many an &ldquo;old grad&rdquo; walked with a prouder step
that day, for once more, after many seasons, the
bird of victory had come back to hover over the
college on the river and the championship banner
would float from the flagstaff on the campus.</p>

<p>Tom and his chums dispersed to dress. A crowd
surrounded the victorious pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me congratulate you, Parsons,&rdquo; said Dr.
Churchill, making his way through the throng.
&ldquo;You have brought honor to the college,&rdquo; and he
shook Tom&rsquo;s hand heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of them did as much as I,&rdquo; replied
Tom modestly. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Clinton&rsquo;s
run, I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;d have lost after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You get out!&rdquo; cried Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I also congratulate you?&rdquo; asked a voice
at Tom&rsquo;s elbow, and he turned to see Miss Tyler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
His face, which was pale from pain, flushed, and
as she held out her hand he hesitated, for his was
all stained from the dirt of the ball, while hers was
daintily gloved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if I minded that!&rdquo; she cried as she saw him
hesitate, and she took his hand in both hers, to the
no small damage of the new gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d do it,&rdquo; she said, while she smiled
happily. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he answered, and after that the pain
in his arm did not seem so bad.</p>

<p>What a triumphant procession it was that
wended its way toward Randall that afternoon!
How song followed song and cheer was piled upon
cheer! Tom sat in the corner of a big auto, with
Miss Tyler at his side. He had to put his arm in
a sling and he was overwhelmed with questions as
to how he felt, while the number of sweaters offered
him as cushions would have stocked a furnishing
store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy, but you&rsquo;re a daisy!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid a
few hours later when he and Tom, after a good
bath, were resting in their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if you didn&rsquo;t cover first base as it never has
been covered before,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, that was easy for me after I passed
that Latin exam. But you and your arm&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
see how you did it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget Phil Clinton. That was one
of the greatest runs and catches I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it certainly was great. But did you
hear the news? Phil isn&rsquo;t going to play any more,
at least for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going into training for our football
eleven this fall. Some of the older heads think
he&rsquo;ll make a great player.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt he will,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s built
for it.&rdquo; And what Tom said was true, as we shall
learn in our next tale, to be called &ldquo;A Quarter-back&rsquo;s
Pluck.&rdquo; In that story we shall meet Tom
and Sid and all the boys of Randall College again
and also Miss Madge Tyler, and learn the particulars
of several fiercely contested games on the gridiron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t really see how you did it,&rdquo; repeated
Sid, &ldquo;with such a sore arm as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, either,&rdquo; answered Tom, but he knew
that the memory of a certain girl had done as much
to keep him up as had his desire to make his team
win.</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More congratulatory calls,&rdquo; said Sid as he went
to open it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; asked a voice, and Langridge
stood in the corridor. Tom arose from the couch
where he was lying.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I just want to congratulate you, dominie,&rdquo;
he said, and he smiled a little, but there was a curious
note in his voice. &ldquo;You did magnificent work.
I could never have equaled it in a thousand years.
Will you shake hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid wondered at the queer air of restraint about
Langridge, but Tom understood, and there was
heartiness and forgiveness in the grip that followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve resigned as manager,&rdquo; went on Langridge.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I hope they&rsquo;ll elect you, dominie. We won&rsquo;t
be rivals any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to leave college?&rdquo; asked Sid
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to give up athletics for a while,
though, and become a grind. I&rsquo;ve been beaten two
ways lately,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Parsons is a better
pitcher than I am, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but he did not
finish, though Tom knew he referred to Miss
Tyler. Then Langridge went out and Sid and
Tom played the game all over again in talk.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shout out on the campus.
Tom looked from the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting ready for the procession and
the bonfires along the river. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two chums rushed downstairs, Phil Clinton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
joining them on the way. Out on the green
was a throng of students, every one in the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Tom Parsons, the best pitcher
that ever tossed a ball!&rdquo; called some one.</p>

<p>How the yells resounded again and again, with
innumerable tigers and other wild and ferocious
beasts added!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fall in! fall in! Down to the fires along the
river!&rdquo; commanded Captain Woodhouse. &ldquo;Oh,
but this is a great day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; added Ford Fenton. &ldquo;My
uncle says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his voice was drowned in the shout that followed,
and then came that inspiring song, &ldquo;<i>Aut
vincere aut mori</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And many fires of victory blazed along Sunny
River that night.</p>

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
